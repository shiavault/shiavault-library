Benefits of the recitation of the chapters of the Holy Qur’an
=============================================================

The Verse “Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim”
--------------------------------------

If we were to give an exhaustive account of the benefits of the
recitation of “Bismillah…” we would need more than a single volume to do
justice to it. Apart from being part of every chapter in the Holy Qur’an
(except the chapter of repentance [*Surah at-tawba]*), it is also the
most oft repeated verse in the Holy Qur’an.

It is narrated in *Tafsir al-Burhaan* that the Holy Prophet (S) has said
that when a person recites “Bismillah...” then five thousand ruby
palaces are built for him in *Jannah* Each palace has a thousand
chambers made of pearls and in each chamber has seventy thousand thrones
of emerald and each throne has seventy thousand carpets made from
special fabrics and upon each carpet is seated a *Hur-ul-Ein*. A person
asked for the condition necessary to get this great reward and the Holy
Prophet (S) replied that the person should recite the “Bismillah…” with
conviction and understanding.

The Holy Prophet (S) has also said that when a believer will have to
cross the *Pul-e-Siraat* on the Day of Judgement, and he will say
“Bismillah…” then the flames beneath him will start dying down until
*Jahannam* will cry out, ‘O believer, pass through quickly, your
presence is causing my fire to die out !’

When a teacher teaches a child to recite “Bismillah…” the child, his
parents and the teacher are all guaranteed freedom from hellfire. It is
narrated that Prophet Isa (a.s.) was once passing by a graveyard and he
saw a grave upon which the Wrath and Punishment of Allah (S.w.T.) was
descending, so he quietly walked past. When he passed the same place
after some time, he noticed that the Mercy and Blessings of Allah
(S.w.T.) was being showered on the same grave. He was surprised at this
and asked Allah (S.w.T.) about what has happened and it was revealed to
him that the man inside the grave was a sinner and was thus being
punished for his sins. When he died, his wife was pregnant and soon gave
birth to a son. When the boy grew older, his mother took him to a
teacher who taught him to recite “Bismillah…” and I felt that it would
not be justice that this man’s son was calling My Name and I was
punishing his father in the grave.

It is also mentioned that recitation of “Bismillah…” with a loud voice
is from the signs of a true believer. Imam Ali Ridha (a.s.) said that
“Bismillah…” is very close to the chosen name of Allah (S.w.T.) *[Isma
A’adham].*

Surah al-Fatihah (The Opening)
------------------------------

There are seven verses in this Surah (chapter) and it is said that this
Surah is both *‘makki’* and *‘madani’* ie. it was revealed in both
Makkah and Madinah.

In the commentary of *Majma’ul Bayan* it is narrated that the Holy
Prophet (S) said that whoever recites this Surah, he will get the reward
for reciting two thirds (2/3) of the whole Qur’an, and will get the
reward equivalent to what would be gained by giving charity to all the
believing men and women in the world.

One of the companions of the Holy Prophet (S) narrates that he once
recited this Surah in the presence of the Holy Prophet (S) and the
Prophet said, ‘By Him in whose hand is my soul, a similar revelation to
this has not been included in the *Taurat* (Torah)*, Injeel* (Bible)*,
Zabur* (Psalms) or even the Qur’an itself.’

The Holy Prophet (S) once asked Jabir ibn Abdallah Ansari, “Should I
teach you a Surah that has no other comparison to it in the whole Qur’an
?” Jabir replied, “Yes, and may my parents be ransom upon you O prophet
of Allah.” So the Holy Prophet (S) taught him Surah al-Fatihah. Then the
Holy Prophet (S) asked, “Jabir, should I tell you something about this
Surah ?” Jabir answered, “Yes, and may my parents be ransom upon you O
prophet of Allah.” The Prophet (S) said, “It (Surah al-Fatihah) is a
cure for every ailment except death.”

Imam AbuAbdillah Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that whoever cannot be
cured by Surah al-Fatihah, then there is no cure for that person. In the
same narration it is written that if this Surah is recited 70 times on
any part of the body that is paining, the pain will surely go away. In
fact, the power of this Surah is so great that it is said that if one
were to recite it 70 times over a dead body, you should not become
surprised if that body starts moving (ie. comes back to life).

Surah al-Fatihah is a cure for physical and also spiritual ailments.
Without this Surah, even the daily prayers are incomplete. It is indeed
a great treasure that has been given to us by Allah (S.w.T.) through the
Holy Prophet (S) and no previous prophet has been given anything like
it. This Surah is also known as *‘Ummul Kitab’* and *‘Sab’a mathani’.*

Surah al-Baqarah (The Cow)
--------------------------

This Surah has 286 verses and is a *‘madani’* Surah ie. it was revealed
in Madinah. It is also the longest Surah in the Holy Qur’an.

The Holy Prophet (S) has said that whoever recites the first four verses
of Surah al-Baqarah, accompanied by the *‘ayatul kursi’* together with
the last three verses of this Surah - and makes a habit of reciting
these verses daily – his life, property and family will be protected and
no evil shall come upon them. *Shaitan* will not come close to him and
he will not be from those who forget Allah (S.w.T.).

Surah Ali-’Imran (The Family of Imran)
--------------------------------------

In this Surah, there are a total of 200 verses and it was revealed in
Madinah. The Holy Prophet (S) has said that whoever recites Surah
Ali-’Imran on Friday, then until the setting of the sun, he will be
showered by the Mercy of Allah (S.w.T.) and the angels will beg for his
forgiveness.

The Prophet (S) has also recommended this Surah for those women who are
not able to conceive. The Surah should be written using *saffron* and
then given to her to wear as a talisman and by the Will of Allah
(S.w.T.) she will conceive.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that if a person faces hardship in
earning his livelihood, he should write this Surah and wear it as a
talisman and Allah (S.w.T.) will increase his sustenance greatly. The
Imam (a.s.) also said that if anyone recites both Surah al-Baqarah and
Ali-’Imran, then these Surahs will come in the shape of clouds on the
day of judgement to protect him from the scorching heat.

Surah an-Nisa (The Women)
-------------------------

This Surah was revealed in Madinah and has a total of 177 verses. In
*‘Tafsir al-burhan’* it is written that Imam Ali (a.s.) has said that
whoever recites this Surah on every Friday, he will remain safe from the
squeezing in the grave *(‘fishare qabr’).*

Surah al-Ma’idah (The Table-spread)
-----------------------------------

There are 120 verses in this Surah and it is a *‘makki’* Surah ie. it
was revealed in Makkah. It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (S) that
whoever recites this Surah, he will get a reward equivalent to ten times
the number of Jews and Christians alive in the world, and will be
forgiven the same amount of sins and will be raised in status by the
same amount.

Surah al-An’aam (The Cattle)
----------------------------

This Surah was revealed in Makkah and contains a total of 165 verses.
Imam Ridha (a.s.) has said that this Surah was revealed accompanied by
the descending of seventy thousand angels. These angels will ask
forgiveness from Allah (S.w.T.) for any person who recites this Surah,
and they will continue doing so until the Day of Judgement.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that if a person writes this Surah
using musk or *saffron* and then drinks it (ie. puts the written Surah
in water for its writing to dissolve) for six consecutive days, that
person will be blessed abundantly and will be free from all problems and
ailments. He will not loose his health or fall sick.

The 6th Holy Imam (a.s.) also said that this Surah must be accorded due
respect as the name of Allah (S.w.T.) appears 70 times in it. If people
knew the benefits of reciting this Surah, they would never leave it.

Surah al-A’araaf (The Elevated Places)
--------------------------------------

There are 206 verses in this *‘makki’* Surah. It is reported from Imam
Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.), that whoever recites this Surah once a month, he
will have no worry or fear on the Day of Resurrection and if it is
recited on a Friday, then the reciter will be from among those who will
be exempted from the taking of accounts on the Day of Judgement.

Surah al-A’araaf has the *ayaat al-muhkamaat* that will give witness on
behalf of its reciter on the Day of Reckoning. The Holy Prophet (S) has
said that there will be a veil between the reciter of this Surah and
*Iblees* on Judgement day and the reciter will be in the company of
Prophet Adam (a.s.)

Writing this Surah with rose water and *saffron* and keeping the writing
at all times ensures safety from enemies and wild animals.

Surah al-Anfaal (The Spoils of War)
-----------------------------------

This Surah was revealed in Madinah and it has 75 verses. In the
commentary of *Majma’ul Bayaan,* it is narrated from Imam Ja’far
as-Sadiq (a.s.) that whoever recites Surah al-Anfaal and Surah at-Tawba
every month, he will be protected from being a hypocrite and will be
counted among the followers of Ameerul Mu’mineen – Imam Ali (a.s.), and
on the day of *Qiyamah* he will eat from the table-spread of *Jannah*
together with all the followers of *Ahlul Bayt.*

This Surah contains the verse about *khums, which* is the right of the
*Ahlul Bayt*. The Holy Prophet (S.) said that he will, on the Day of
Judgement, intercede for the person who recites this Surah and will bear
witness that the reciter of this Surah was free from hypocrisy. Keeping
Surah al-Anfaal in your possession at all times ensures that you get
your rights that have been taken from you and your legitimate desires
are fulfilled.

Surah al-Bara’at - at-Tawba (The Repentance)
--------------------------------------------

This Surah has 129 verses and was revealed in Madinah. This Surah was
revealed all at once and its revelation was accompanied by seventy
thousand angels. It is narrated that keeping this Surah over one’s head
(like in a cap or *Amama*) is a safety from thieves and destruction of
property by fire. Also, keeping this Surah in one’s possession ensures
safety from the evil designs of enemies.

Surah Yunus
-----------

This Surah is *‘makki’* and it has 109 verses. It is narrated from Imam
Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) that if a person recites this Surah once in two
or three months, he will not be placed alongside the ignorant ones and
will be from among the *‘muqarrabeen’* (close ones) on the Day of
Reckoning. It is also narrated that if a person recites Surah Yunus, he
will get the reward equal to the number of people who were present in
the community of Prophet Yunus (a.s.).

This Surah can be used as a means of identifying thieves from among your
workers. This is done by either writing the Surah and under it writing
the names of all the people in the house or workplace who could be
suspected of stealing and then keeping this writing in the house. It
will, after some time, become manifest who the thief is.

Surah Hud
---------

This Surah was revealed in Makkah and has a total of 123 *ayaat*
(verses). Imam Muhammad Baqir (a.s.) has said that whoever recites this
Surah every Friday, his accounts will on the Day of Judgement, be taken
together with that of the Prophets and all his sins will be forgiven.

It is narrated from the Holy Prophet (S.) that the person who recites
Surah Hud will get a reward equal to the number of people who were there
at the time of the Holy Prophet (S) and his rank will be like of the
martyrs. The accounting for his deeds will also be made easy for him.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that writing this Surah on a
sheepskin and keeping it in one’s possession at all times makes one so
courageous and bold that nobody can defeat him in combat. Whoever sees
him will be filled with fear.

Surah Yusuf
-----------

Surah Yusuf has 111 *ayaat* and was revealed in Makkah. It is narrated
that the Holy Prophet (S) said that whoever recites this Surah and
teaches his family members how to recite it also, Allah (S.w.T.) will
make the final moments before his death *(sakaraatul mawt)* easy for him
to bear and will remove jealousy from his heart.

It has been narrated from Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq that whoever recited this
Surah daily, he will be raised on the day of *Qiyamah* with the
handsomeness of Prophet Yusuf (a.s.) and he will be protected from the
fear and discomfort of this day. He will be raised among the pious
servants of Allah (S.w.T.). This Surah also keeps one’s heart safe from
illegitimate lustful desires.

The sixth Imam (a.s.) has also said that if a person drinks the water in
which this Surah has been dissolved, then his sustenance will be easier
to reach and he will be made from the people of *Jannah.*

Surah Ra’d
----------

There are 43 *ayaat* in this Surah and it is *‘makki’* though some
*Mufassireen* (those who have written commentaries of the Holy Qur’an)
say that the last verse of this Surah was revealed in Madinah. In fact,
some even go as far as saying that the whole of this Surah is *‘madani’*
except for two verses.

The Holy Prophet (a.s.) has been quoted as saying that whoever recites
this Surah will be made from among those who fulfil their promise to
Allah (S.w.T.) and they will be given reward which is ten times the
number of sins they have committed.

It is narrated that Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that if a
*mu’min* recites this Surah often, he will be taken to *Jannah* without
having to give the long and detailed accounts for his deeds on Earth. He
will also be allowed to intercede on behalf of his relatives and
friends.

If this Surah is written at night, after the time for *Isha* prayers,
under a candle’s light, and then hung outside the door of a tyrant
ruler’s palace, then the ruler will perish and so will his control over
the people. His army and his supporters will betray him and nobody will
listen to him.

Surah Ibrahim
-------------

This is a *‘makki’* Surah that has 52 *ayaat*. It is narrated by Imam
Ja’far as-Sadiq that whoever recites Surah Ibrahim and Surah Hijr in a
two-rak’aat prayer on every Friday, he will remain safe from poverty,
insanity and sudden calamity.

In the commentary of *Burhan*, it is mentioned that writing this Surah
on a white parchment and then making a child wear it as a talisman keeps
the child safe from ailments and makes it easy for him to drink and
digest milk.

Surah Hijr
----------

There are 99 verses in this *‘makki’* Surah. It is narrated from the
Holy Prophet (S) that whoever recites Surah Hijr will get the reward
equal to the number of *Muhajireen* and *Ansaar* (companions of the Holy
Prophet [S.]) and this Surah should be written with *saffron* and then
worn as a talisman by a new mother who cannot produce enough milk for
her child.

If written and tied on one’s arm, it makes any business conducted by the
wearer to be profitable and makes people like doing business with him.
His sustenance thus increases. In a narration by Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq
(a.s.) one can also put this Surah (written) inside the pocket or safe
(for storing valuables).

Surah an-Nahl (The Bee)
-----------------------

This Surah was revealed in Makkah and has 128 *ayaat*. In the commentary
of *Majma’ul Bayan* it is recorded from the Holy Prophet (S) that
whoever recites this Surah will not be questioned, on the Day of
Judgement, about the blessings he received on the Earth and will get the
reward equal to the amount of people who left a good will when they
died.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that whoever recites Surah an-Nahl
once every month, he will be safe from 70 types of diseases and will be
from among the people of *Jannah.* This Surah should, however, under no
circumstance be written and kept in the house or garden as it may have
harmful effects. Imam Sadiq (a.s.) has said that if kept in a house or
garden, it will soon be destroyed. Indeed this is a weapon that one is
only allowed to use against an evil person who is the enemy of Islam.

Surah Bani-Isra’il (Children on Israel)
---------------------------------------

There are 111 verses in this *‘makki’* Surah. The Holy Prophet (S) has
said that a great reward will be accorded to those who recite this Surah
and when they reach the verse about parents, they feel a sense of love
and gentleness towards their parents.

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) that whoever recites
Surah Bani-Isra’il every Thursday night, will not die before meeting
Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.) and will be counted among his companions. Also, if a
child is not able to speak or is delaying in his learning how to speak,
he should be given the water of this Surah that has been written with
*saffron*.

In the commentary of *Safi* it is written that the Holy Prophet (S) told
Imam Ali (a.s.) that the last two verses of this Surah are a protection
and safety from theft. This Surah is also called Surah al-Isra’.

Surah al-Kahf (The Cave)
------------------------

This Surah has 110 *ayaat* and it was revealed in Makkah. The Holy
Prophet (S) has said that whoever recites this Surah will be protected
from *fitna* (evil) for eight days. If a person recites the last verse
of Surah al-Kahf before sleeping at night, Allah (S.w.T.) creates a
*noor* (light) from his sleeping place up to the Holy Ka’bah and in this
light are angels who continually pray for the reciter until he wakes up.

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) that if a person wishes
to wake up at a particular time, he should recite the last *ayah* of
this Surah and then make the intention that he will wake up at a certain
time and he will wake up at that time. He (a.s.) also said that if a
person recites this Surah every Thursday night, he will die the death of
a martyr. Keeping this Surah (written) in the house becomes a means of
protection from poverty and debts.

Surah Maryam
------------

There are 99 *ayaat* in this *‘makki’* Surah. It is written in the
commentary of *Majma’ul Bayan* that the reward for reciting this Surah
is equal to ten times the number of people present at the time of
Prophet *Zakariyyah (a.s.), Yahya (a.s.), Isa (a.s.), Musa (a.s.), Ishaq
(a.s.), Harun (a.s.), Ibrahim (a.s.), Ya’qub (a.s.)* and *Isma’il
(a.s.)* combined.

Keeping this Surah (written) in the house ensures protection from
thieves and Allah (S.w.T.) blesses the occupants of the house. It is
also narrated that before going in the presence of a tyrant ruler, if a
person recites *‘Kaf-Ha-Ya-’Ain-Saad’* and closed, with each letter, one
finger of his right hand, and then recites *‘Ha-Mim-‘Ain-Seen-Qaaf’* and
with each letter, closes one finger of his left hand; and then he comes
in the presence of the tyrant and recites *‘wa ‘anatil wujuhu lil hayyil
qayyum wa khaaba man hamala dhulma’* and then he opens his fingers, he
will be protected from the evil of the tyrant.

Surah Taha
----------

This Surah was revealed in Makkah and has 135 verses. It is mentioned in
a narration from the Holy Prophet (S) that whoever recites this Surah
will get the reward equivalent to the number of companions of the Holy
Prophet (S) from the *Muhajireen* and *Ansaar.*

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that Allah (S.w.T.) befriends the
ones who recite this Surah and this person will receive his book of
deeds on his right hand. His sins will be forgiven and he will get so
much reward that he will be pleased on the Day of Judgement.

This Surah should be recited before war, going before a tyrant ruler and
trying to guide a community towards the path of Allah (S.w.T.). If a
girl is not getting married and she wishes to get married, she should
take *ghusl* (bath) with water in which this Surah has been dissolved
and by the will of Allah (S.w.T.) she will get married.

If a man wishes to get married, he should write verses 131 and 132 of
this Surah with *saffron* and then wear it as a talisman and
*InshaAllah* his proposal will be accepted.

Surah al-Ambiya’ (The Prophets)
-------------------------------

This *‘makki’* Surah has 112 *ayaat*. It is narrated that the reward for
reciting this Surah is that the accounting on the Day of Reckoning
becomes easy for the reciter and all the Prophets whose names appear in
the Holy Qur’an will come to meet him on this day.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) has said that whoever recites Surah
al-Ambiya’ frequently, his status in *Jannah* will be close to the
Prophets. Writing this Surah and keeping it with one removes all stress
and worry.

Surah al-Hajj (The Pilgrimage)
------------------------------

There are 78 *ayaat* in this Surah and it was revealed in Makkah. The
Holy Prophet (S) has said that reciting this Surah carries the reward
equal to the number of pilgrims who have been for Hajj and those who
will go for Hajj in the future.

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq has said that whoever recites this Surah once in
every three days will get the opportunity of going for Hajj in the same
year, and if he dies on the way, he will be granted *Jannah*. Someone
asked what would happen if the person performing the Hajj was a sinner,
so the Imam (a.s.) replied that his punishment would be reduced.

given the good news of his position by angels.

It is narrated from Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) that whoever recites
this Surah on every Friday, he will have a great status in the hereafter
and will be in the company of prophets. If this Surah is written (at
night) and put on the neck of a drunkard, he will start hating
intoxicating drinks and will stop this bad habit.

There are 64 *ayaat* in this Surah and it was revealed in Madinah. In

lifetime, see any evil from his near ones and when he dies, seventy
thousand angels will accompany his body up to the grave and will pray
for his forgiveness.

The Holy Prophet (S) said that it is especially good for women to recite
this Surah. He (S) also said that the reward for reciting this Surah is
equal to ten times the number of *mu’mineen* and *mu’minaat* on the
Earth. The sixth Imam (a.s.) said that keeping this Surah in one’s bed
prevents wet dreams.

-------------------------------

This Surah has 77 *ayaat* and it is *‘makki’*. The Holy Prophet (S) has
said that a person who recites this Surah will be taken to *Jannah*
without questioning, provided he believes in the Day of Judgement and
the Raising of the Dead (from the graves).

Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) said that Allah (S.w.T.) will never send His
punishment upon any person who recites this Surah every night. The

never be harmed by the vermin of this earth.

Allah (S.w.T.). The reward for reciting this Surah is so great that when
the person sees the reward he has gotten from it (on the Day of
Judgement) he will be pleased.

The Holy Prophet (S) said that the one who recites this Surah will come
out of his grave reciting the *Shahadah* or *Kalimah,* bearing witness
in the Oneness of Allah (S.w.T.). Reciting Surah ash-Shu’ara at dawn is
compared to the recitation of all the heavenly books that have been

Surah at-Tawhid. After a little while, the man became abundantly
wealthy.

It is narrated that if a person does not recite this Surah in any of his
five daily prayers, it is as if he has not prayed. In fact, if a person
does not recite this Surah in any of his prayers for seven consecutive
days, and he dies, it will be as if he died while following the religion
of Abu Lahab.

It is makruh to recite this Surah in one breath. This Surah has numerous
other benefits and is a cure for many ailments. It should be recited
when travelling or when facing a tyrant ruler.

Surah al-Falaq (The Dawn)
-------------------------

This is a *‘madani’* Surah and it has 5 *ayaat*. It is narrated from the
Holy Prophet (S) that whoever recites this Surah in the month of
Ramadhan in any of his prayers, it is as if he has fasted in Makkah and
he will get the reward for performing Hajj and ‘Umra.

Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (a.s.) said that in the prayer of *Shafa’a* (in
Salaatul-layl) one should recite Surah al-Falaq in the first rak’aat and
an-Naas in the second.

Surah an-Naas (The Man)
-----------------------

This Surah was revealed in Madinah and it has 6 *ayaat.* Surah an-Naas
and al-Falaq are together called *Ma’udhatayn*. Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq
(a.s.) has said that whoever recites this Surah in his house every
night, will be kept safe from *Jinnaat* and the evil designs of
*Shaitan*.

If this Surah is put around the neck of a child as a talisman, the child
will be protected from *Jinnat*. Reciting the *Ma’udhatayn* before
sleeping is a means of safety and if recited on any part of the body
that is paining, the pain will be relieved.
