Angels Prostration For Adam Puh
===============================

Said God let praise be to Him: And when We said unto the angels:
Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they fell prostrate, all save Iblis.
He demurred through pride, and so became a disbeliever (Al-Baqarah: 34).
And in another position He said to Iblis blaming him for not
prostrating: He said: What hindered thee that thou didst not fall
prostrate when I bade thee?

(Al-A'raf: 12). The damned said then: I am better than him. Thou
createdst me of fire while him Thou didst create of mud, and continued:
Now, because Thou hast sent me astray, verily I shall lurk in ambush for
them on Thy Right Path, then I shall come upon them from before them and
from behind them and from their right hands and from their left hands,
and Thou wilt not find most of them beholden (unto Thee). And also said:
Reprieve me till the day when they are raised (from the dead). and God
answered: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved Till the Day of appointed
time. And God said also: and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was
of the jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord's command (Al-Kahf: 50)

So the phrases that points out the facts about the creation of Adam
(PUH) and the prostration of Angels before him after the commandments of
God and the rebel of Iblis against God's command for he is created of
fire and Adam was created of mud or clay and God's damnations upon him
and his exile out of paradise and keeping him unable to get through the
veils while he used to go through them with Angles before and the
request of Iblis for God to compensate him for his worship to God for
thousands of years and the God's answer to him and giving him whatever
he likes of life's goods and the most important of those goods is
staying alive as long as life do exist and being in control of Adam's
descendants and being close to them as blood in the vessels and Made
(God) their chests a home for him and for his sons (Iblis) except the
faithful slaves of God, such phrases are a lot in the Holy Book and they
can be founded also in Holy Books that was revealed before Quran.

Meditate in these Holy phrases a meditation of thinking and not as
memorizing a tale. Without understanding the desired meaning of God's
speech, and you must check out the truth from these who who know Quran
very well, or their viceroys, who act and do as they did, and don't take
saying meant to give explanation to the phrases of the Book of your God
who said: None knoweth its explanation save Allah. And those who are of
sound instruction say: We believe therein;

the whole is from our Lord; but only men of understanding really heed
(Al-Imran: 7), and those who know are only who upon them the Holy Book
was revealed and that is Muhammad (PUH) and his descendants who had the
Prevention (They make no mistakes) and they know better. [Note: this
paragraph contained a high level of philosophical terms which I couldn't
translate nor understand, so it was approperiate to take the overall
meaning and translate it]

And what was told of tidings from them (the Holy Family PUT) that
growing proud was the first sin, so Iblis did say: O Lord, release me
from prostration before Adam, and I used to worship you as no close
Angel did nor a sent prophet, then the God did say to him: no need for
your worshipping, but I want to be worshipped as I want not as you want.
And so Iblis refused to prostrate, then God said to him: Get out of it,
you are damned. Then said Iblis: O Lord! how? and you are the Just that
does no wrong, so my reward for worshipping is false? Then God said to
him: No, but ask anything of life's matter as a reward for your deeds
and I shall give it to you.

The first thing he asked was to be immortal until the time of the
doomsday, so God said to him: it is yours.Then he asked to be in control
of Adam's descendants, so God said to him: I made you of control. Then
he asked to make him run through them as blood in vessels, so God said
to him: I made you run through them.

Then Iblis did say: no one would give a birth for one, shall be
accompanied by two for me, and I will see them but they won't and I
would be shaped in front of them in whatever shape I like, so the God
said then: I give all of that. Then the damned (Iblis) said: O Lord,
give me more. So then the God said: I made for you and your descendants
homes in their chests. After all that Iblis did say: O Lord, this is
enough for me. Then that he did say: O Lord by your Highness I would
make them do mischiefs except your faithful slaves, then I shall come
upon them from before them and from behind them and from their right
hands and from their left hands, and Thou wilt not find most of them
beholden.

It was told about the explanation of the Holy phrase "then I shall come
upon them from before them" is that "I will make them not serious in
thinking of the doomsday" like telling them that God is merciful and
only punishes for worshipping another, but everything else God can
forgive you about. And "from behind them" that is "I will order them to
keep on gathering money and be misers to keep it for their heirs", and
"from their right hands" that is "I will worsen their believes and let
them add and change their creeds", and "from their left hands" that is
"I will make their hearts in great love for joys and amusement and
whatever like it."

From Ibn 'Abbâs, that the first one to measure (compare) was Iblis, and
he was wrong in this matter, and whoever after him would do the same he
would be paired by God in the doomsday with Iblis, and the measurement
(comparement) is that when he said: You made me of fire and made him of
mud (or clay), and that meant to be that I'm (Iblis speaking) of more
honour than him (Adam) and better, because fire is higher and of more
honour than mud, and so the prostrate must have been from him (Adam) to
me (Iblis) and not the other wise by the measurements of honour and
priority,

and the damned didn't know the honour of Adam and of what God knows
from his virtues (Adam's) and the Holy Lights that he bore in his
descendants, and it will come from his descendants the prophets and
their viceroys with the saints and the faithful, and the masters of the
creation, Muhammad and his Household (family, descendants) that God wish
is but to remove uncleanness far from them, and cleanse them with a
thorough cleansing, who are the main reason for the creation of the
universe and everything in it. And so he (Iblis) envied him (Adam) and
got wicked. And for the God's saying "Lo! I am about to create a mortal
out of mire, And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My
Spirit,

then fall down before him prostrate" (Sad: 71,72) the Prince of
Believers ('Ali ben Abi Tâlib PUH) commented about this: They all
prostrated, except Iblis who got pride growing into him for his creation
of fire and scorned the mud (or clay) creation, and so God gave him the
delay for he (Iblis) deserved damnations, and for the completeness of
his trouble, and the completeness of his mortality, so God said to him:
Then lo! thou art of those reprieved, Till the Day of appointed time
(Al-Hijr: 37,38).

Notice how much did the Prince of Believers (PUH) overflow us with the
facts about this interesting matter of unique meanings and wisdom that
could be deduced from its deepest secrets and its hidden jokes. We have
left out most of his speech (PUH) for the fear of boredom, and it was
told that after what God gave to Iblis from control and power, Adam
(PUH) said: O Lord, you have given Iblis the control over my descendants
and made him run as the blood in the vessel into them and all of the
other things that you gave to him, so for what for me and my
descendants?

So God answered him: the wrong done would be counted as one, and the
good done would be counted as ten. Then did Adam (PUH) say: O Lord, give
me more, so the God answered: Repentance would be accepted until the
soul would come to the throat [apparently meant at death time], then
Adam (PUH) said: O Lord, give me more. So the God answered: I will
forgive no matter what, then Adam (PUH) said: O Lord this is quite
enough. One questioner did say to Al-Imam Al-Sâdiq (PUH): O may I be a
ransom to you, for what did Iblis deserve all of what God gave him? he
answered (PUH): for something he did to God and God appreciated that for
him, then the question did say: and what did he do may I be a ransom to
you? he answered (PUH): for two bows (kneeling, in prayer) he did in
heavens in a time of four thousands years.

And it was told from Al-Nahj [Nahj Al-Balâgha, a book that collected
speeches of 'Ali ben Abi Tâlib PUH] that Al-Imam 'Ali (PUH) said that he
(Iblis) did pray two bows in heavens in six thousands years. It is not
known if it is counted as years of earthly time, or in time of heavens,
and it is not quite far that both tales are true and God only knows.

From Tawoos and Mojâhid: that Iblis before doing the sin was one of the
Angels and his name was 'Azâziel, and he was one of the earth's
inhabitants, and the inhabitants of earth from Angels were called the
Djinn, and among Angels there were on like him in his worshipping and
wisdom, so when he rebelled against God may praise be to Him, God damned
him and made him a demon and called him Iblis, and he was noted as being
a disbeliever in God's knowledge.

The apparent from this tale that Iblis was one of the Angels opposes
the apparent phrase from the Holy Book "all save Iblis. He was of the
jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord's command" (Al-Kahf: 50) and also
opposes the famous opinion among the wise men of Muslims and its tales
and stories, and it is the base that all Muslims agreed on naturally and
the repeated phrases in the Holy Book about this matter, and the most of
the explanations made for them (the phrases), and even it opposes the
thought of Iblis when he said: You created me of fire and created him of
mud..etc and so this tale opposes the most famous opinions about the
matter so be aware.

From Jameel ben Darâj said: I asked Abâ 'Abdullah Al-Sâdiq (PUH) about
whether Iblis was one of the Angels or Djinn, so he said (PUH): Angels
saw that he was one of them but only God knew that he wasn't one of
them, and when was ordered to prostrate he did what he did. Some wise
men that are into deep insight said that wise men of Islam differ in
considering whether Iblis is one of the Angels or not. Most of the
speakers about the matter and lot of our wise men [Shiites wise men are
meant here] like Al-Shaikh Al-Mofeed and others that said that Iblis is
one of the Djinn and not Angels, and then he said (Al-Shaikh Al-Mofeed)
that tidings been told frequently from the Imam's of Guidance (PUT)
about this fact, and it is true in the creed of Imamism. [Imamism: this
term is coined by me and don't know if there is an equivalent term for
it. It points out to the creed of believing in the 12 viceroys or Imams
after the death of the prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him and his
Household], and other branch believed that he (Iblis) was one of the
Angels.

The clue of the second branch that believed that Iblis is one of the
Angels is from some Hadith's (or speeches) and one of them is what have
been mentioned before from Tawoos and Mojâhid, and also believed that
Iblis was one of the keepers of paradises, and he held the treasures of
heavens and earth, and other stuff had been said, but anyhow as you can
see nothing of that is convenient to what was mentioned about the
believe of the first branch which is the most choosen and the most
supported with the confession of Iblis himself as mentioned before.

It had been told from Al-Zajjâj that he said: Holy phrases did differ
in mentioning of what did the creation of Adam (PUH) start with. In one
position in the Holy Book that God created him out of sand, and in other
out of mud, and in another out of black mud, and also in another
position out of clay. He continued: and all of the previous belong to
one origin which is the sand, which is the origin of mud, and so God
informed us that he made him out of sand, then made it into mud, then
transferred into black mud and finally as clay.
