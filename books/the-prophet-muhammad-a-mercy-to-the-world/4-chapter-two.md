Chapter Two
===========

Even while Lord of Arabia, he mended his own shoes and coarse woollen
garments, milked the ewes, swept the hearth, and kindled the fire; Dates
and water were his usual fare, and milk and honey his luxuries.

John Davenport "An Apology for Mohammed and the Koran" London 1869
Sublime Qualities of Prophet Muhammad

**Inspirational Conducts**

The Prophet Muhammad, the final Messenger and Apostle of God, may Allah
bless him and his family, had the greatest of morals in all aspects of
life. When Imam Ali son of AbY ?"lib, peace be upon them, was asked
about this he said: 'How can I describe the morals of the Prophet when
God himself has testified that they are 'sublime' when He said: eAnd
most surely you have sublime morals f 26.

The Prophet's wife, when asked about his morals answered: 'The morals
of the Apostle of God were [an embodiment of] the Qur'an.'27

Before the advent of his prophetic mission he acted under the
supervision of God and was being prepared according to a divine plan to
be a living embodiment of loftiness and 26 The Holy Qur'an; The Pen
(67): 4 27 The White Path (al-ma9ajjah al-bay+"'); vol.4, p.120

eminence. This divine preparation was alluded to by Commander of the
Faithful Imam Ali ibn AbY ?"lib who knew the Prophet better than anyone
else among the Muslims, when he said: 'From the time that he was weaned,
God placed him in the company, day and night, of the greatest of His
angels to show him the path of virtue and the most excellent morals of
the world.' 28

**His Dealings with the People**

It is related that H{usayn son of Imam Ali, peace be upon them both,
said: 'I asked my father about how the Apostle of God, may Allah bless
him and his family, would spend his time indoors. He said: 'When he
sought the refuge of his house he would divide his time into three
parts; one part for God, one part for his family, and one part for
himself. Then the part that was for himself he would divide between
himself and the people; both those close to him and the general public,
and he would spare all the time that he could for them. It was his
policy regarding the time he set aside for the Muslim community to
favour the virtuous with his manners and he divided his time according
to their virtue in the religion. Among them were those who had a single
need, those who had two needs, and those who had a number of needs. He
would concern himself with them and occupy them with what would benefit
both them and the community by asking about them and getting them to
inform him of what was needed. He would say: 'Let those present inform
those who are absent and whoever is not able to inform me of his needs
then let someone else do it on his behalf.'29

29 sunan al-nab:; p.14

Imam H{usayn relates: 'Then I asked my father about how the Apostle of
God spent his time outside the house. He said:

'The Apostle of God, may Allah bless him and his family, would guard
his tongue except in matters which concerned him. He would work to unite
the people and not divide them. He would honour the nobles of every
people and place them in authority over them. He would warn the people
against discords. He would be on his guard with the people at all times
but would never withhold from them his smile or good manners. He would
miss those of his companions who were absent and would ask the people
about the affairs of the people, and would encourage what was beautiful
and good and discourage what was ugly and bad.

He was balanced and did not go to extremes and would never become
heedless for fear that the people would become heedless and divert from
the right path. He was prepared for every situation and would not fall
short of the truth nor go beyond it. It was the best of the people who
followed him. In his view the best of them were those who gave the best
counsel and the highest in station were those who gave the best
solidarity and support.'30

Imam H{usayn relates: 'Then I asked my father about his gatherings. He
said: 'Whenever the Apostle of God sat down to a meeting or stood up
from one he would always be in remembrance of God, glory be to His name.
Whenever he sat with some people he would always stay until the end of
the gathering and would order others to do the same. He would give each
of those present his due so that everyone would think that they were the
most honoured person present. Whenever he sat with someone or stood with
him regarding a matter, he would wait patiently until the other person
was

30 mak"rim al-akhl"q; p.13

satisfied and left. If anyone asked him for anything he would either
give him what he asked or speak to him some kind words. His openness and
good manners enveloped the people and he was to them as a father and to
him they all had equal rights. His gatherings were gatherings of
kindness and modesty, patience and trust, where voices were not raised
and sanctity was not trampled upon. There the people vied with each
other to be the most just and the most virtuous and God- conscious. They
would respect the elders and treat the young with mercy and give
preference to those in need and protect the stranger.'31

Imam H{usayn also relates that his father said: 'The Apostle of God was
constantly smiling, and very easy to get along with.

He was not uncouth or hard-hearted, loud voiced or immodest. He would
not seek to find faults with people nor to flatter people.

He would ignore and avoid that which he did not like, but [no one]
would lose hope from him nor would he disappoint anyone.

He forbade himself three things: showing off, excess in anything and
[interfering in] those things which did not concern him.

He held back three things from the people: he would not condemn or
rebuke anyone, nor would he seek out another's secrets, and would only
speak in matters in which he sought a divine reward.

31 ibid; p.14

When he spoke his companions lowered their heads as though birds had
landed upon them32 and when he fell silent they spoke. They would not
vie with each other to speak, and when he spoke they would pay attention
until he had finished. They spoke with him as they spoke normally; he
would laugh with them when they laughed and be amazed when they were
amazed. He would bear the uncouth language and questions of a stranger
with patience.

He would say: 'If you see someone in need then aid him'. He would not
accept praise except from his equals. He would never interrupt another
person when he was speaking until he asked permission or until the
speech had ended or the other person stood up to leave.33

It is related that Zayd ibn Th"bit said: 'When we sat with the Prophet
and we began to talk about the afterlife he would join in with us. If we
began to talk about worldly affairs he would also join in with us. If we
began to speak about food and drink he would also join in with us.'34 It
is related that Imam Ali said: 'The Apostle of God, may Allah bless him
and his family, whenever he saw that one of his companions was dejected
he would joke with him to delight him.'35

Anas said: 'Whenever the Apostle of God he passed by some children
would always greet them.'36

attentiveness

36 mak"rim al-akhl"q; p.16

Asm"' daughter of Zayd relates: 'The Prophet passed by some women and
greeted them.'37 Whenever any of his companions or anyone else called
him he always said: 'At your service.'38 He would always call his
companions by their kunyas39 to honour them and win their hearts over
and would always give a kunya to those who did not have one after which
that person would be known by this kunya. He would also give kunyas to
the ladies who had children and those who did not. He would also give
kunyas to youngsters to soften their hearts.'40

The Apostle of God was among the most courteous of people. He would not
hold back on cold mornings from going to a male or female servant or a
child and washing their face and hands for them. Whenever someone asked
him something he always paid attention and would always wait until the
other person left so that he himself would not be the first to leave.
Whenever someone offered him his hand he would accept it.41

**His Humility**

Ibn Abb"s relates: 'The Apostle of God, may Allah bless him and his
family, would sit upon the earth, and eat upon the earth. He would milk
the ewe, and respond to the invitation

[to food] of the freeman and the slave even for the simple trotter
meal.'42 Imam £"diq peace be upon him relates: 'Whenever the Apostle of
God entered a meeting place he would always sit in the lowliest place in
the gathering.'43

The prophet's wife was asked: 'What does the Prophet do in private?'
She said: 'He sews his clothes and mends his shoes and does what a man
usually does when he is with his wife.'44

He used to say: 'There are five things I will not stop doing until I
die; eating on the floor with the servants, riding on the saddle of a
donkey, milking goats with my hand, wearing wool, and greeting children,
so that these may become traditions [of humility for others] after I am
gone.'45

Im"m H{asan, peace be upon him, in a tradition about the manners of the
Apostle of God says: 'No, I swear by Almighty God that he would never
lock himself behind doors, nor let doormen or guards keep him concealed,
he would not be occupied by being served with morning or afternoon
meals, . . . but rather he was in full view. Whoever wished to meet the
Prophet of God could do so. He would sit upon the ground and place his
food on the ground and wear rough clothes and ride upon a donkey and let
others ride behind him...'46

It is related that Ibn Ab: Awf" said: 'The Apostle of God did not
disdain or consider himself to be above walking with widows or paupers
and fulfilling their needs.'47 Anas ibn M"lik relates: 'No-one was more
beloved to his companions than the Apostle of God. When they saw him
they would never stand up as they knew how much he hated that.'48

**The Symbol of Love and Blessings**

'When he spoke those present would lower their heads as though birds
had landed upon them and when he fell silent they would speak and they
would not vie with each other to speak.'49

Orwah ibn Mas!Yd al-Thaqaf: described the depth of the Muslims' love
for the Apostle of God and their commitment and obedience to him, when
the Quraysh sent him as a legate regarding the question of the peace
treaty of al-H{odayb:yah. Orwah said addressing the Quraysh: 'O people,
I swear by Almighty God that I have been in the presence of kings, and I
have been in the presence of the Caesar of Rome and the Chosroe of
Persia and the Negus of Abyssinia, but, by God, I have never seen a king
whose companions revere him as the companions of Muhammad revere him.
When he orders them they make haste to implement his orders. When he
performs his ablutions they almost kill each other [seeking blessings
from] the water of his ablutions. When he speaks they lower

their voices and they do not stare at him out of reverence for him.'50
Anas ibn M"lik relates: 'I saw the Apostle of God when the barber was
cutting his hair. His companions had surrounded him seeking to catch his
hair in their hands as it fell.'51

It is related that Im"m al-Ri+", peace be upon him, said: 'I heard my
father relating from his father, from my great grandfather from J"bir
ibn Abdull"h AnN"ri52, who said: 'The Apostle of God was in a tent of
leather. I saw Bilal of Abyssinia53 who had just come out with the
leftover water from the Apostle of God's ablutions. The people rushed to
him and whoever succeeded in getting some would wipe his face with it.
Whoever did not get any would take it from the hand of his companion and
wipe his face with it.'54

Anas ibn M"lik said: 'I served the Apostle of God for some years and he
never swore at me ever, nor did he ever hit me, nor did he rebuke me,
nor did he frown in my face, nor did he reproach me for being tardy in
carrying out his orders. If

50 bi9"r al-anw"r; vol.20, p.332, chap.20
51 ibid. vol. 17, p.32, chap.14, 9ad:th 14.

52 J"bir ibn Abdull"h AnN"ri was one of the devout and loyal companions
of the Prophet Muhammad who went on to live long enough to meet the
Prophet's fifth appointed successor, Imam B"qir, as foretold by the
Prophet - some seventy years after the Prophet's death As well as to
Imam Ali at the time of the Messenger of God, J"bir paid homage of
allegiance to every one of the Prophet's successors he met. J"bir is
considered as one of the reliable narrators of the Prophetic hadith 53
Bilal was a black African slave who was bought off by the Prophet from
his Quraysh masters and set free, and he went on to become the Prophet's
assistant.

54 bi9"r al-anw"r; vol. 17, p 33, chap. 14, 9ad:th 14. Beirut edn.

anyone of his wives reproached me he would say: 'Let him be, for if a
thing is ordained it will be.'55

**His Clement and Forgiving Nature**

It is related that Anas said: 'I was walking with the Apostle of God
and he was wearing a rough cloak from Najr"n. A Bedouin Arab approached
him and pulled him so violently by his cloak that I saw that the Apostle
of God's shoulder had been marked by the rough cloak. Then the man said:
'O Muhammad, give me some of God's wealth that you have!' The Apostle of
God turned to him and laughed and ordered a gift for him.'56

During one of the battles, one of his companions said to him:

'Invoke God against the Polytheists!' The Prophet said: 'I have been
sent as a mercy and guidance and have not been sent to curse people.'57
The Apostle of God used to say: 'My Lord has enjoined upon me seven
things: he has enjoined upon me sincerity in secret and in public, and
that I forgive those who have wronged me, and that I give to those who
have withheld from me, and that I maintain bonds with those who cut off
from me, and that my times of silence are spent in thought, and that
whatever I see I derive a lesson from it.'58

When he left the tribe of Thuqayf after having been insulted and
tormented by them one of his companions said: 'O Apostle of God, invoke
God against them.' He said: 'O God,

55 ibid. vol. 16, chap. 9

Edition.
58 sunan al-nab:; p.71

give guidance to the tribe of Thuqayf and bring them to us [so that
they learn Islam].'

In another account it is said: 'The Prophet never struck a woman or a
servant and indeed, he never struck a single thing with his hand except
when he was fighting in the way of Almighty God. If ever he was harmed
he would never take revenge on the person who had harmed him except when
something sacrosanct of his had been desecrated, then he would take
action.

It is related that Im"m H{asan said: 'The Apostle of God would not be
angered by the mundane world or the matters belonging to it, but if the
truth was transgressed against then nothing could withstand his anger
until he could succour it. He would not become angry for his own affair
nor would he succour it.'59

**His Steadfastness**

The Apostle of God was persevering and steadfast to the utmost degree.
For example, when AbY ?"lib informed him of what the Quraysh had been
plotting for him and for the Clan of H"shim in general he said: 'O
uncle, if they were to put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my
left hand on condition that I forgo this mission, I would not forgo it
until God makes it prevail or I perish in the process.'60 He would
encourage the first Muslims to stand up to opposition and to stay with
the truth and would say: 'There were those before you whose flesh and
nerves would be raked

59 mak"rim al-akhl"q; p.13.
60 Ibn Ath:r; al-k"mil f: al-ta'r:kh; vol.1, p.587, Beirut edition.

to the bone with steel rakes and they would not relinquish their
religion, and saws would be placed upon the middle of their heads and
they would be sawn in two and they would not relinquish their religion.
God will fulfil this mission until one will be able to ride from £ana!"
to H{a+ramaut fearing nothing but God and the wolf for his flocks, but
you are too hasty.'61

When he visited the city of al-?"'if, he was treated in the worst
possible manner by the people of the city, who incited the children and
slaves against him and they began stoning him until wherever he put his
foot there was a stone, and they split open his head and wounded his
body. However he did no more than pray and supplicate to Almighty God
saying: 'O God, to you I complain of my weakness and my lack of means
and my insignificance in the eyes of the people, O Most Merciful One,
you are the Lord of the enfeebled ones and you are my Lord. To whom will
you deliver me? To an enemy from afar who is scowling at me or an enemy
whom you have given dominion over my affair? As long as your anger is
not upon me then I do not care, although your protection I prefer.'62

His most difficult days were during the battles of O9ud and the
Confederates (al-A9z"b). In the battle of O9ud the Muslims were routed
by the forces of polytheism after they had disobeyed the orders given by
the Prophet Muhammad. No-one remained at the heart of the fighting
except the Apostle of God, Imam Ali, and certain sincere companions. The
Prophet was severely injured; his nose was broken and his face was split
open and he lost copious blood until false

61 bi9"r al-anw"r; vol.18, p.210.
62 bi9"r al-anw"r; vol.19, p.17, chap.5, 9ad:th 9.

news spread that he had died. Despite this however, he remained
steadfast until God put an end to the adversity.

In the campaign of the Confederates, the believers were under extreme
pressure which the Holy Qur'an speaks of saying: eAnd when they came
upon you from above you and from below you and when your eyes trembled
and your hearts came into your mouths and you began to have doubtful
thoughts about God. There the believers were tested and were shaken most
severely f63

The Muslims were in danger of being annihilated by the army of the
Confederates who had lain siege to Medina, and the Apostle of God
witnessed all this, which was of such severity that the perseverance of
great men vanquished before it. However, the Apostle of God remained
steadfast and optimistic of victory during this trial and rose above it
with his endurance, and by this he gave hope to the believers and raised
their spirits and gave them strength and strengthened their trust in
Almighty God. He made plans to confront the situation with the utmost
poise and determination until God gave victory to His servant and
Apostle, and defeated the Confederates Himself.

**His Abstinence**

The Apostle of God was a supreme example in abstinence. It is related
that Ibn Abb"s said: 'Once, Omar entered into the presence of the
Apostle of God who was seated upon a mat of straw fibres which had left
marks upon his side. Omar said: 'O Prophet of God, it would be better if
you got a couch for yourself!' He said: 'What have I got to do with this
mundane

63 The Holy Qur'an: The Confederates (33): 11.

world? As far as myself and this world are concerned, I am like a rider
who has travelled on a hot summer's day and taken shade below a tree for
an hour or so and then left it and continued his journey.'64

Ibn Abb"s also said: 'The Apostle of God used to go without eating
every other night and his family could find nothing to eat. Mostly their
bread was of barley.'65

It is related that once he washed his robe and was without a robe
[until it dried], or he gave his clothes to a poor person and was
without clothes himself as he did not own another robe so he covered
himself with a straw mat.

In certain Qur'anic commentaries it is said that the meaning of God's
words: e?"h" We sent not this Qur'an down upon you so that you might
become distressed f66 is that you are not required to be so harsh with
yourself to the extent that you don't have more than one set of clothes
to your name so that when you give your clothes to a poor person or wash
your clothes you are without clothes and have to cover yourself with
straw matting. This was an indication from God that He would be pleased
with the Prophet even if he was less of a paradigm.
