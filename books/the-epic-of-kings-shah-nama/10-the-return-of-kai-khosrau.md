The Return of Kai Khosrau
=========================

In a little time it came about that there was born unto Ferangis, in the
house of Piran, a son of the race of Saiawush. And Piran, when he had
seen the babe, goodly of mien, who already in his cradle was like unto a
king, sware a great oath that Afrasiyab should not destroy it. And when
he went before the King to tell unto him the tidings, he pleaded for him
with his lips. Now the heart of Afrasiyab had been softened in his
sorrow for Saiawush, wherefore he shut his ear unto the evil counsellors
that bade him destroy the babe which should bring vengeance upon Turan.
And he said-

" I repent me of mine evil deed unto Saiawush, and though it be written
that much evil shall come upon me from this child sprung from the loins
of Tur and Kai Kobad, I will strive no more to hinder the decree of the
stars; let him, therefore, be reared unto manhood. Yet I pray that he be
brought up among shepherds in the mountains far from the haunts of men,
and that his birth be hidden from him, that he may not learn of his
father or of the cruel things I did unto Saiawush."

And Piran consented unto the desires of Afrasiyab, and he rejoiced
because he had spared the babe. Then he took the infant from its mother
and bare it unto the mountains of Kalun, and confided the boy unto the
shepherds of the flocks. And he said-

"Guard this child even as your souls, so that neither rain nor dust come
near him."

Thus it came about that no man knew of the babe, neither did Ferangis
know whither it was vanished. But oftentimes was Piran sore disturbed in
his spirit, for he knew that the beginning of strife was yet to come,
and that much evil must befall Turan from this infant. Yet he forgot not
his promise of protection given unto Saiawush his friend, whom he had
led to put his trust in Afrasiyab. So he quieted his spirit from
thinking, for he knew that no man can change the course of the stars.

Now when some time was passed the shepherds came out to Piran and told
him how they could not restrain this boy, whose valour was like to that
of a king. Then Piran went forth to visit Kai Khosrau, and he was amazed
when he looked upon him and beheld his beauty and his strength, and he
pressed him unto his heart with tenderness. Then Kai Khosrau said-

"O thou that bearest high thy head, art thou not ashamed to press unto
thee the son of a shepherd? "

But Piran was inflamed with love for the boy, so he pondered not his
words, but said-

"O heir of kings, thou art not the son of a shepherd." Then he told him
of his birth, and clad him in robes befitting his station, and took him
back with him unto his house. And henceforward was Kai Khosrau reared in
the bosom of Piran and of Ferangis his mother. And the days rolled above
their heads in happiness.

Then it came about one night that Piran was awakened by a messenger from
Afrasiyab the King. And the King bade Piran come before him. And when he
was come unto him, he said-

"My heart is disquieted because of the child of Saiawush, and I repent
me of my weakness which kept him alive; for in my dreams I have beheld
that he will do much evil unto Turan. Wherefore I would now slay him to
avert calamity."

Then Piran, wise in counsel, opened his mouth before Afrasiyab and
spake, saying-

"O King, disquiet not thyself because of this boy, for he is devoid of
wit; and though his face be like unto that of a Peri, his head, which
should bear a crown, is empty of reason. Commit, therefore, no violence,
but suffer that this innocent continue to dwell among the flocks."

Afrasiyab, when he had listened to these words of wile, was comforted;
yet he said-

"Send Kai Khosrau before me, that I may behold with mine eyes his
simplicity."

And Piran assented to his request, because he ventured not to gainsay
it. So he returned him unto his house and sought out the boy, and told
him how he should disguise his wit before the King. Then he led him unto
the court mounted upon a goodly charger, and all the people shouted when
they beheld his beauty and his kingly mien. And Afrasiyab too was
confounded at his aspect, and he gazed with wonder at his limbs of
power, and he strove to remember the promise that he had given unto
Piran that he would not hurt a hair of the head of this boy. Then he
began to question him that he might search his spirit. And he said-

"Young shepherd, how knowest thou the day from the night? What doest
thou with thy flocks? How countest thou thy sheep and thy goats?"

And Kai Khosrau replied-

"There is no game, and I have neither cords nor bow and arrows."

Then the King questioned him concerning the milk that was given of the
herds. And Kai Khosrau said-

"The tiger-cats are dangerous and have mighty claws."

Then Afrasiyab put to him yet a third question, and he asked of him-

"What is the name of thy mother?"

And Kai Khosrau answered and said-"

"The dog ventureth not to bark when a lion threateneth him."

Then Afrasiyab asked him yet again whether he desired to go forth into
the land of Iran and be avenged upon his enemies. And Kai Khosrau
answered and said-

"When a leopard appeareth, the heart of a brave man is torn with fear."

And Afrasiyab smiled at these answers and questioned him no further. And
he said unto Piran-

"Restore the boy unto his mother, and let him be reared with kindness in
the city that Saiawush hath builded, for I behold that from him can no
harm alight upon Turan."

When Piran heard these words he hastened to remove Kai Khosrau from the
court, and his heart was glad because of the danger that had passed by.
So Kai Khosrau was reared in the house of his father, and Ferangis spake
unto him of Saiawush and of the vengeance that was due. And she
instructed him concerning the heroes of Iran and their deeds of prowess,
as she had learned them from Saiawush her lord.

In the mean season Kai Kaous had learned of the death of Saiawush his
son, and a mighty wailing went forth throughout the land of Iran, so
that even the nightingale in the cypress was silent of her song, and the
leaves of the pomegranate tree in the forest were withered for sorrow.
And the heroes that stood about the throne of Kai Kaous clad themselves
in the garb of woe, and bare dust upon their heads in place of helmets.
And Rustem, when he learned of it, was bowed to the earth with agony,
and for seven days he stirred not from the ground, neither would he let
food or comfort come near him. But on the eighth he roused him from the
earth, and caused the trumpets of brass to be sounded into the air. And
he assembled his warriors, and marched with them into Iran, and he came
before Kai Kaous and demanded audience.

Now when he was come into the presence-chamber he found the Shah seated
upon his throne. He was clothed in dust from his head unto his feet,
because of his grief. But Rustem regarded it not, and straightway
reproached him, and said-

"O King of evil nature, behold the harvest that is sprung from the seed
that thou didst sow! The love of Sudaveh and her vile intents have torn
from off thy head the diadem of kings, and Iran hath suffered cruel loss
because of thy folly and thy suspicions. It is better for a king that he
be laid within his shroud than that he be given over to the dominion of
a woman. Alas for Saiawush! Was ever hero like unto him? And
henceforward I will know neither rest nor joy until his cruel death be
avenged."

When Kai Kaous had listened to the words of his Pehliva, the colour of
shame mounted into his cheek, but he held his peace, for he knew that
the words spoken of Rustem were deserved. Then Rustem, when he saw that
the King answered him not, strode out from his presence. And he went
into the house of the women, and sought for Sudaveh, who had given over
Saiawush unto death. And when he had found her, he tore her from off her
throne, and he plunged his dagger into her heart, and he quitted her not
until the life was gone from her. And Kai Kaous, when he learned it,
trembled and was afraid, for he dared not oppose himself unto Rustem.
Then Rustem commanded that the army of vengeance be made ready. And he
said-

"I will make the earth to tremble before my mace, as it shall tremble on
the day of judgment."

And when all was prepared they made them haste to be gone, and the air
was full of the gleaming of armour, and the rattling of drums was heard
on all sides.

Now when Afrasiyab learned that a great army was come forth from Iran to
avenge the death of Saiawush, he bade Sarkha, the best beloved of his
sons, lead forth the hosts of Turan against them. But he craved Sarkha
have a care that Rustem, the son of Zal, put not his life in danger. And
Sarkha set forth, bearing aloft the black banner of Turan, and he went
towards the plains where Rustem was encamped. Now when the armies beheld
one another, their hearts were inflamed, and the battle raged sore, and
many were the brave heads laid low on that day. And Sarkha fell into the
hands of Rustem, and he spared him not, because he was the best beloved
son of Afrasiyab. So he gave orders that Sarkha be slain, even as
Saiawush was slain, that the heart of his enemy might be rent with
anguish.

And when Afrasiyab learned it he was beside himself with grief. And when
he had torn his hair and wailed in the dust for his son, he arose to go
forth unto the army, that he might avenge his death. And he said unto
his knights-

"Henceforth ye must not think of sleep or hunger, neither must ye
breathe aught but vengeance, for I will never stay my hand until this
murder be avenged."

Now when the army that was with Afrasiyab came nigh unto Rustem, Pilsam,
that was brother to Piran, a warrior valiant and true, challenged Rustem
unto single combat. Then Piran sought to stay him because of his youth,
but Pilsam listened not unto his counsel. So Rustem came forth against
him, and he was armed with a stout lance, and he was wrapped about with
his anger. And he fell upon Pilsam with fury, and he lifted him from his
saddle, and he took him by the girdle and flung him, as a thing that is
vile, into the midst of the camp of the Turanians. Then he shouted with
a voice of thunder-

"I counsel you, wrap ye this man in robes of gold, for my mace hath made
him blue."

Now when the Turanians beheld that Pilsam was dead, they wept sore, and
their courage departed from out of them. And in vain did Afrasiyab pray
them to keep their hearts. Yet he said within himself-

"The good fortune that watched over me is asleep."

And when they were met in battle yet again, and the army of Rustem had
beaten down once more that of Afrasiyab, the King bethought him of
flight. And the hosts of Turan vanished like to the wind, but they left
behind them much riches and goodly treasure.

Now while they were flying from the face of Rustem, Afrasiyab said unto
Piran-

"Counsel me how I shall act concerning this child of Saiawush."

And Piran said, "Haste not to put him to death, for he shall in nowise
do thee hurt. But if thou wilt listen unto my voice, send him far into
Khoten, that he be hidden from sight, and that the men of Iran learn not
of his being."

And Afrasiyab did as Piran counselled, and a messenger was sent forth to
lead out the young King and his mother unto the land of Cathay. And
Afrasiyab himself fled until that he came within the borders of China,
and no man knew where he was hidden. And the land of Turan was given
over to plunder, and the Iranians scathed it with fire and sword because
of Saiawush, whom Afrasiyab had foully slain. And Rustem seated himself
in the seat of Afrasiyab, and for the space of seven years did he rule
over the land. But in the eighth messengers came out to him, and said
how that Kai Kaous was without a guide in Iran, and how they feared lest
folly might result from his deeds. So Rustem went forth to stand beside
his Shah.

Now when Afrasiyab learned that Rustem was departed out of the land of
Turan, his fears forsook him, and he gathered together a mighty army,
and he fell upon his borders, and he regained them unto himself. And he
wept when he beheld the havoc that was come upon Turan, and he incited
his army to be avenged. So they fell into Iran, and shattered its host,
and they suffered not that repose come near unto their foes. And they
pursued them with fire and sword, and laid waste their fields. And
during seven years the heavens withheld their rains, and good fortune
was turned away from Iran, and the prosperity of the land was quenched.
And men groaned sore under these misfortunes, neither did Rustem come
forth from Zaboulistan unto their aid.

Then it came about one night that Gudarz, who was descended from Kawah
the smith, dreamed a dream. He beheld a cloud heavy with rain, and on
the cloud was seated the Serosch the blessed. And the angel of God said
unto Gudarz-

"Open thine ears, if thou wilt deliver thy land from anguish, and from
Afrasiyab the Turk. There abideth in Turan the son of a noble race, an
issue sprung from the loins of Saiawush, who is brave, and beareth high
his head. And he is sprung from Kai Kobad and from Tur, and from him
alone can deliverance come to Iran. Suffer, therefore, that Gew, thy
son, go forth in search of Kai Khosrau, and bid him remain in his saddle
until he shall have found this boy. For such is the will of Ormuzd."

When Gudarz awoke, he thanked God for his dream, and touched the ground
with his white beard. And when the sun was risen and had chased away the
ravens of night, he called before him his son, and he spake to him of
his dream. And he commanded him that he go forth to do the behests of
God.

And Gew said, "I will obey thine orders while I live."

Then Gudarz said, "What companions wilt thou take with thee?

And Gew said, "My cord and my horse will suffice unto me for company,
for it is best to take none with me into Turan. For behold, if I lead
out an host, men will ask what I am, and wherefore I come forth; but if
I go alone, their doubts will slumber."

Then Gudarz said, "Go, and peace be upon thee."

So Gew made ready his steed, and when he had bidden farewell unto the
old man his father, he set out upon his travels. And wherever he met a
man walking alone, he questioned him concerning Kai Khosrau; and if the
man knew not the name, he struck off his head, that none might learn his
secret or wherefore he was come forth.

Now Gew wandered thus many days throughout the length of Turan, like to
a man distraught, and he could learn nought concerning Kai Khosrau, the
young king. And seven years rolled thus above his head, and he grew lean
and sorrowful. And for house he had nought save only his saddle, and for
nourishment and clothing the flesh and skin of the wild ass, and in
place of wine he had only bad water. And he began to be downcast in his
spirit, and afraid lest the dream dreamed of his father had been sent
unto him by a Deev. Now it came about one day that while he pondered
thus he entered a forest, and when he was come into its midst, he beheld
therein a fountain, and a young man, slim as a cypress, seated beside
it. And the youth held in his hand a wine-cup, and on his head was a
crown of flowers, and his mien was such that the soul of Gew rejoiced
thereat, and the door of his cares was loosened. And he said within
himself-

"If this be not the King, then must I abandon my search, for I think to
behold in him the face of Saiawush."

Then he went nigh unto him.

Now when Kai Khosrau beheld the warrior, he smiled and said-

"O Gew, thou art welcome unto my sight, since thou art come hither at
the behest of God. Tell unto me now, I pray thee, tidings of Tus and
Gudarz, of Rustem, and of Kai Kaous the King. Are they happy? Do they
know of Kai Khosrau?"

When Gew heard this speech, he was confounded; and when he had returned
thanks unto God, he opened his mouth and spake, saying-

"O young King, who bearest high thy head, reveal unto me who hath told
thee of Gudarz and of Tus, of Rustem and of Kai Kaous, and how knowest
thou my name and aspect."

Then Kai Khosrau said, "My mother hath told me of the things which she
learned of my father. For I am son unto Saiawush, and before he entered
upon death he foretold unto Ferangis how Gew would come forth from Iran
to lead me unto the throne."

Then Gew said, "Prove unto me thy words. Suffer that mine eyes behold
the mark of the Kaianides which thou bearest about thy body."

Then Kai Khosrau uncovered his arm, and when Gew looked upon the mark
that was borne of all the royal house since the time of Kai Kobad, he
fell down upon the ground and did homage before this youth. But Kai
Khosrau raised him from the dust and embraced him, and questioned him
concerning his journey and the hardships he had passed through. Then Gew
mounted the young King upon his charger, and he walked before him
bearing an Indian sword unsheathed in his hand. And they journeyed until
they came to the city that Saiawush had builded.

Now when Ferangis saw them she received them joyfully, for her quick
spirit divined what was come to pass. But she counselled them to tarry
not in whatsoever they would do. For she said-

"When Afrasiyab shall learn of this he will neither eat nor sleep, he
will send out an army against us. Let us flee, therefore, before he
cometh. And listen now unto the words that I shall speak. Go forth unto
the mountain that is raised unto the clouds, and take with thee a saddle
and a bridle. And when thou shalt have scaled its crest thou wilt behold
a meadow green as a paradise, and browsing upon it the flocks of
Saiawush. And in their midst will be Behzah the steed of battle. Go nigh
unto him, my son, and embrace him, and whisper thy name into his ear;
and when he shall have heard it he will suffer thee to mount him, and
seated upon him thou shalt escape from the slayer of thy father."

Then Gew and Kai Khosrau went out and did as Ferangis told unto them;
and they found the steed, and when Behzah beheld the saddle of Saiawush
and the leopard-skin he had worn, he sighed, and his eyes were filled
with tears. Then he suffered Kai Khosrau to mount him, and they turned
back unto Ferangis. And she chose forth the armour of Saiawush from
among her treasures and gave it to her son, and she clad herself in mail
of Roum like unto a warrior, and she sprang upon a horse of battle, and
when all was done they set forth to fly from the land of Afrasiyab.

Now one brought tidings unto Piran of these things, and he was dismayed
thereat, for he said-

"Now will be accomplished the fears of Afrasiyab, and mine honour will
be tarnished in his eyes."

So he bade Kelbad and three hundred valiant knights pursue Kai Khosrau
and bind him and bring him back in chains.

Now Ferangis and her son slept for weariness by the roadside, but Gew
held guard over them. And when he beheld Kelbad and the men that were
with him, he knew that they were come in pursuit; yet he awakened not
Kai Khosrau, but of his strength alone put them to flight. But when they
were gone he roused the sleepers, and he urged haste upon them.

But Piran, when he beheld that Kelbad returned unto him defeated at the
hand of one man, was loath to credit it, and he was angered against him,
and said that he would go forth himself. So Piran made him ready, and a
thousand brave warriors went with him. For Piran was afraid of the anger
of Afrasiyab, and that he would put this flight unto his account, and
not unto that of the rotation of the stars. Now when he was come unto
the fugitives Gew and the young King slumbered, but Ferangis was keeping
watch. And when she beheld the army she woke them and bade them prepare
for combat; but Gew suffered not that Kai Khosrau should go forth, for
he said-

"If I fall, what mattereth that? my father hath seventy and eight sons
like unto me; but thou art alone, and if thy head shall fall, what other
is worthy of the crown?"

And Kai Khosrau did as Gew desired. Then Gew gave combat unto Piran, and
by his courage he overcame the army; and he caught the old man Piran in
the meshes of his cord. Then he brought him bound before Ferangis and
Kai Khosrau her son.

Now Piran, when he beheld Kai Khosrau, demanded not mercy at his hands,
but invoked the blessings of Heaven upon his head, and he mourned the
fate of Saiawush. And he said-

"O King, had thy slave been nigh unto Afrasiyab, surely the head of thy
father would not have fallen at his hands. And it was I who preserved
thee and Ferangis thy mother, yet now is it given unto me to fall under
thy hands."

When Kai Khosrau heard these words his heart went out unto Piran, and
when he looked towards his mother he saw that her eyes were filled with
tears. Then she opened her mouth and poured forth curses upon Afrasiyab
her father, and she wailed the fate of Saiawush, and she pleaded for the
life of this good old man. For she said-

"His tenderness hath been an asylum unto our sorrow, and now is it given
unto us to remember the benefits we have received at his hands."

But Gew, when he heard it, said-

"O Queen, I pray thee speak not thus, for I have sworn a great oath that
I would stain the earth with the blood of Piran, and how can I depart
from my vow?"

Then Kai Khosrau said, "O hero like unto a lion, thou shalt not break
the oath that thou hast made before God. Satisfy thy heart and
accomplish thy vow. Pierce with thy dagger the ear of Piran, and let his
blood fall on the earth, that thy vengeance and my clemency may both be
satisfied."

Then Gew did as Kai Khosrau bade, and when he had crimsoned the earth
with the blood of Piran, they mounted him upon a charger fleet of foot
and bound him thereon, and caused him to swear unto them that none other
but Gulshehr his wife should release him from these bonds. And Piran
sware it and went forth, and his mouth poured blessings upon Kai
Khosrau.

Now while these things were passing Afrasiyab grew impatient, and set
forth himself at the head of a great army that he might learn tidings of
Kai Khosrau. And when he heard that the armies had been beaten at the
hand of one man, his cheeks grew pale with fear; but when he met Piran
his Pehliva tied upon his charger, his anger knew no bounds, so that he
cried aloud, and commanded Piran that he depart from out his presence.
Then he sware that he would himself destroy this Gew, and lay low the
head of Kai Khosrau and of his mother. And he made great haste after
them, and he urged upon his men that they must find Kai Khosrau before
he should have crossed the Jihun and have entered upon the land of Iran;
yet before ever he was come nigh to them, the three were come unto its
banks.

Now, a boat was lying ready, and a boatman slumbered beside it; and Gew
roused him, and said that he should bear them across the river. But the
man was greedy of gain, and beheld that Gew was in haste. So he said-

"Why should I carry thee across? Yet, if thou desire it, I demand that
thou give unto me one of four things: thy coat of mail, or thy black
horse, yon woman, or the crown of gold worn by this young man."

Then Gew was angry, and said-

"Thou speakest like a fool; thou knowest not what thou dost ask."

Then he turned unto Kai Khosrau, and said-

"If thou be Kai Khosrau indeed, thou wilt not fear to enter this river
and cross it, even as it was crossed by Feridoun thy sire."

Now the river was swollen with the rains, but the young King regarded it
not. He entered upon its surge with Behzah his steed, and the horse of
his father bare him across the boiling waters. And Ferangis followed
after him and Gew the bold. And when Kai Khosrau was come unto the other
side, he dismounted and knelt and kissed the ground of Iran, and gave
thanks unto God the mighty.

Yet scarce were they come to the other side than Afrasiyab came up with
his army. And Afrasiyab demanded of the boatman wherefore he had borne
them across, and when the man told him how it was come to pass, the King
was bowed down with anguish, for he knew now that that which was written
would be accomplished. So he returned him right sorrowful unto his
house.

Now when Kai Khosrau came nigh unto the courts of the Shah, Gew sent a
writing unto Kai Kaous and told him all that was come to pass. And Kai
Kaous sent forth riders to lead before him his son; and the city was
decked to give him welcome, and all the nobles received him joyfully,
and Kai Kaous was glad at the sight of him, and all men regarded Kai
Khosrau as the heir, and only Tus was sorrowful at that which was come
to pass. But Tus was angered, and said that he would pay homage only
unto Friburz, and to none other. And he came before Kai Kaous and said-

"Friburz is thy son also, why therefore wilt thou give the crown unto
one who is sprung from the race of Afrasiyab?

Then Gew said, "It is fitting that the son of Saiawush should succeed
unto the throne."

But Tus listened not, and refused allegiance unto Kai Khosrau, and there
was strife among the nobles of Iran.

Then one came before Kai Kaous and begged of him that he would declare
himself, for he said-

"If we are divided among ourselves we shall fall a prey into the hands
of Afrasiyab. Let the Shah, therefore, bind up this quarrel."

Then Kai Kaous said, "Ye ask of me that which is hard, for both my sons
are dear unto me, and how should I choose between them? Yet I will
bethink me of a means to quiet this dissension. Let Kai Khosrau and
Friburz go forth unto Bahman, the fortress that is upon my borders which
no man hath conquered, for it is an abode of Deevs, and fire issueth
thence continually. And let them take with them an army, and I will
bestow my crown and my treasures upon him at whose hands the castle
shall be subdued."

So Friburz and Kai Khosrau set forth, and Kai Khosrau suffered that his
elder take the lead. But in vain did Friburz strive against the Deevs
that were hidden behind the walls, and when seven days had passed he
returned discomfited from his emprise. Then Kai Khosrau set forth, and
he wrote a letter, amber-perfumed, and in it he desired the evil Deevs
that they give place unto him in the name of Ormuzd. And he affixed the
letter unto the point of his lance, and when he was come nigh unto the
burning fort he flung it beyond the walls. Then a great noise rent the
air like thunder, and the world became darkened, and when the light
returned unto the sky the castle was vanished from off the face of the
earth.

Now when Kai Kaous heard it, he knew that the son of Saiawush was
learned in the arts of magic, as was fitting unto a king; and he beheld
also that he was wise and brave. And because that he was weary he
surrendered the throne unto him, and Kai Khosrau wore the crown of the
Kaianides in his stead.
