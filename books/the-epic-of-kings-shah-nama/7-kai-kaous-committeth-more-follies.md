Kai Kaous Committeth More Follies
=================================

Whilom the fancy seized upon the Shah of Iran that he would visit his
empire, and look face to face upon his vassals, and exact their tribute.
So he passed from Turan into China, and from Mikran into Berberistan.
And wheresoever he passed men did homage before him, for the bull cannot
wage battle with the lion. But it could not remain thus for ever, and
already there sprang forth thorns in the garden of roses. For while the
fortunes of the world thus prospered, a chieftain raised the standard of
revolt in Egypt, and the people of the land turned them from the gates
of submission unto Iran. And there was joined unto them the King of
Hamaveran, who desired to throw off the yoke of Persia. But Kai Kaous,
when the tidings thereof came unto him, got ready his army and marched
against the rebels. And when he came before them, their army, that had
seemed invincible, was routed, and the King of Hamaveran was foremost to
lay down his arms and ask pardon of his Shah. And Kai Kaous granted his
petition, and the King departed joyously from out his presence. Then one
of those who stood about the Shah said unto him-

"Is it known to thee, O Shah, that this King hideth behind his curtains
a daughter of beauty? It would beseem my lord that he should take this
moon unto himself for wife."

And Kai Kaous answered, "Thy counsel is good, and I will therefore send
messengers unto her father, and demand of him that he give me his
daughter as tribute, and to cement the peace that hath been made between
us."

When the King of Hamaveran heard this message his heart was filled with
gall, and his head was heavy with sorrow, and he murmured in his spirit
that Kai Kaous, who owned the world, should desire to take from him his
chiefest treasure. And he hid not his grief from the Shah in his answer,
but he wrote also that he knew it behoved him to do the thing that Kai
Kaous desired. Then in his distress he called before him Sudaveh his
daughter, whom he loved, and he told her all his troubles, and bade her
counsel him how he should act. For he said-

"If I lose thee, the light of my life is gone out. Yet how may I stand
against the Shah?"

And Sudaveh replied, "If there be no remedy, I counsel thee to rejoice
at that which cannot be changed."

Now when her father heard these words he knew that she was not afflicted
concerning that which was come about. So he sent for the envoy of Kai
Kaous and assented unto his demands, and they concluded an alliance
according to the forms of the land. Then when the King had poured gifts
before the messenger, and feasted him with wine, he sent forth an escort
to bear his daughter unto the tents of the Shah. And the young moon went
forth in a litter, and she was robed in garbs of splendour, and when Kai
Kaous beheld her loveliness he was struck dumb for very joy. Then he
raised Sudaveh unto the throne beside him, and named her worthy to be
his spouse. And they were glad in each other, and rejoiced; but all was
not to be well thus quickly.

For the King of Hamaveran was sore in his heart that the light of his
life was gone from him, and he cast about in his spirit how he should
regain her unto himself. And when she had been gone but seven days, he
sent forth a messenger unto Kai Kaous and entreated him that he would
come and feast within his gates, so that all the land might rejoice in
their alliance.

When Sudaveh heard this message her mind misgave her, and she feared
evil. Wherefore she counselled the Shah that he should abstain from this
feast. But Kai Kaous would not listen unto the fears of Sudaveh, he
would not give ear unto her warning. Wherefore he went forth unto the
city of the King of Hamaveran, and made merry with him many days. And
the King caused gifts to be rained down upon Kai Kaous, and he flattered
him, and cozened his vanity, and he made much of his men, and he
darkened their wits with fair words and sweet wine. Then when he had
lulled their fears, and caused them to forget wherefore and why and all
knowledge of misfortune, he fell upon them and bound them with strong
chains, and overthrew their glories and their thrones. And Kai Kaous did
he send unto a fortress whose head touched the sky and whose foot was
planted in the ocean. Then he sent forth a strong band into the camp of
Iran, and veiled women went with them, and he charged them that they
bring back Sudaveh unto his arms.

Now when Sudaveh saw the men and the women that went with them she
guessed what was come about, and she cried aloud and tore her robes in
anguish. And when they had brought her before her father she reproved
him for his treachery, and she sware that none should part her from Kai
Kaous, even though he were hidden in a tomb. Then the King was angered
when he saw that her heart was taken from him and given to the Shah, and
he bade that she be flung into the same prison as her lord. And Sudaveh
was glad at his resolve, and she went into the dungeon with a light
heart, and she seated herself beside the Shah, and served him and
comforted him, and they bore the weight of captivity together.

After these things were come about, the Iranians, because that their
Shah was held captive, returned unto Iran much discomfited. And when the
news spread that the throne was empty many would have seized thereon.
And Afrasiyab, when he learned it, straightway forgot hunger and sleep,
and marched a strong army across the border. And he laid waste the land
of Iran, and men, women, and children fell into bondage at his hands,
and the world was darkened unto the kingdom of light. Then some arose
and went before the son of Zal to crave his help in this sore need,
saying unto him-

"Be thou our shield against misfortune, and deliver us from affliction,
for the glory of the Kaianides is vanished, and the land which was a
paradise is one no more."

Now Rustem, when he heard the news, was grieved for the land, but he was
angered also against the Shah that he had thus once again run into
danger. Yet he told the messengers that he would seek to deliver Kai
Kaous, and that when he had done so he would remember the land of Iran.
And forthwith he sent a secret messenger unto Kai Kaous, a man subtle
and wise, and caused him to say unto the Shah-

"An army cometh forth from Iran to redeem thee. Rejoice, therefore, and
cast aside thy fears."

And he also sent a writing unto the King of Hamaveran, and the writing
was filled with threats, and spake only of maces and swords and combat.
And Rustem loaded the King with reproaches because of his treachery, and
he bade him prepare to meet Rustem the mighty.

When the King of Hamaveran had read this letter his head was troubled,
and he defied Rustem, and threatened him that if he came forth against
him he should meet at his hands the fate of the Shah. But Rustem only
smiled when he heard this answer, and he said-

"Surely this man is foolish, or Ahriman hath filled his mind with
smoke."

Then he mounted Rakush, and made ready to go into Hamaveran, and a vast
train of warriors went after him. And the King of Hamaveran, when he saw
it sent forth his army against him. But the army were afraid when they
beheld Rustem and his might of mien, his mace, and his strong arms and
lion chest, and their hearts departed from out their bodies, and they
fled from before his sight, and returned them unto the King of
Hamaveran.

Now the King was seated in the midst of his counsellors, and when he saw
the army thus scattered before they had struck a blow, his heart misgave
him, and he craved counsel of his chiefs. Then they counselled him that
he should cast about him for allies. So the King of Hamaveran sent
messengers of entreaty unto the Kings of Egypt and Berberistan, and they
listened to his prayers, and sent out a great army unto his aid. And
they drew them up against Rustem, and the armies stretched for two
leagues in length, and you would have said the handful of Rustem could
not withstand their force. Yet Rustem bade his men be not discomfited,
and rest their hopes on God. Then he fell upon the armies of the Kings
like to a flame that darteth forth, and the ground was drenched with
gore, and on all sides rolled heads that were severed from their bodies;
and wheresoever Rakush and Rustem showed themselves, there was great
havoc made in the ranks. And ere the evening was come, the Kings of
Egypt and Berberistan were his captives; and when the sun was set, the
King of Hamaveran knew that a day of ill fortune was ended. So he sent
forth to crave mercy at the hands of the Pehliva. And Rustem listened to
his voice, and said that he would stay his hand if the King would
restore unto him Kai Kaous, and the men and treasures that were his.
Then the King of Hamaveran granted the just requests of Rustem. So Kai
Kaous was led forth from his prison, and Sudaveh came with him. And when
they beheld him, the King of Hamaveran and his allies declared their
allegiance unto him, and they marched with him into Iran to go out
against Afrasiyab. And Sudaveh went with the army in a litter clothed
with fair stuffs, and encrusted with wood of aloes. And she was veiled
that none might behold her beauty, and she went with the men like to the
sun when he marcheth behind a cloud.

Now when Kai Kaous was come home again unto his land, he sent a writing
unto Afrasiyab. And he said-

"Quit, I command thee, the land of Iran, nor seek to enlarge thyself at
my cost. For knowest thou not that Iran is mine, and that the world
pertaineth unto me?"

But Afrasiyab answered, "The words which thou dost write are not
becoming unto a man such as thou, who didst covet Mazinderan and the
countries round about. If thou wert satisfied with Iran, wherefore didst
thou venture afield? And I say unto thee, Iran is mine, because of Tur
my forefather, and because I subdued it under my hand."

When Kai Kaous had heard these words he knew that Afrasiyab would not
yield save unto force. So he drew up his army into array, and they
marched out to meet the King of Turan. And Afrasiyab met them with a
great host, and the sound of drums and cymbals filled the air. And great
was the strife and bloody, but Rustem broke the force of Turan, and the
fortunes of its army were laid to rest upon the field of battle. And
Afrasiyab, when he beheld it, was discomfited, and his spirit boiled
over like to new wine that fermenteth. And he mourned over his army and
the warriors that he had trained, and he conjured those that remained to
make yet another onslaught, and he spake fair promises unto them if they
would deliver unto his hands Rustem, the Pehliva. And he said-

"Whoever shall bring him alive before me, I will give unto him a kingdom
and an umbrella, and the hand of my daughter in marriage."

And the Turks, when they heard these words, girded them yet again for
resistance. But it availed them nought, for the Iranians were mightier
than they, and they watered the earth with their blood until the ground
was like a rose. And the fortunes of the Turks were as a light put out,
and Afrasiyab fled before the face of Rustem, and the remnant of his
army went after him.

Then Kai Kaous seated himself once more upon his throne, and men were
glad that there was peace. And the Shah opened the doors of justice and
splendour, and all men did that which was right, and the wolf turned him
away from the lamb, and there was gladness through all the length of
Iran. And the Shah gave thanks unto Rustem that he had aided him yet
again, and he named him Jahani Pehliva, which being interpreted meaneth
the champion of the world, and he called him the source of his
happiness. Then he busied himself with building mighty towers and
palaces, and the land of Iran was made fair at his hands, and all was
well once more within its midst.

But Ahriman the wakeful was not pleased thereat, and he pondered how he
could once again arouse the ambition of the Shah. So he held counsel
with his Deevs how they might turn the heart of Kai Kaous from the right
path. And one among them said-

"Suffer that I go before the Shah, and I will do thy behest."

And Ahriman suffered it. Then the Deev took upon him the form of a
youth, and in his hand he held a cluster of roses, and he presented them
unto the Shah, and he kissed the ground before his feet. And when Kai
Kaous had given him leave to speak he opened his mouth and said-

"O Shah, live for ever! though such is thy might and majesty that the
vault of heaven alone should be thy throne. All the world is submissive
before thee, and I can bethink me but of one thing that is lacking unto
thy glory."

Then Kai Kaous questioned him of this one thing, and the Deev said-

"It is that thou knowest not the nature of the sun and moon, nor
wherefore the planets roll, neither the secret causes that set them in
motion. Thou art master of all the earth, therefore shouldst thou not
make the heavens also obedient to thy will?"

When Kai Kaous heard these words of guile his mind was dimmed, and he
forgot that man cannot mount unto the skies, and he pondered without
ceasing how he could fly unto the stars and inquire into their secrets.
And he consulted many wise men in his trouble, but none could aid him.
But at last it came about that a certain man taught him how he could
perchance accomplish his designs. And Kai Kaous did according to his
instructions. He built him a framework of aloe-wood, and at the four
corners thereof he placed javelins upright, and on their points he put
the flesh of goats. Then he chose out four eagles strong of wing, and
bound them unto the corners of this chariot. And when it was done, Kai
Kaous seated himself in the midst thereof with much pomp. And the
eagles, when they smelt the flesh, desired after it, and they flapped
their wings and raised themselves, and raised the framework with them.
And they struggled sore, but they could not attain unto the meat; but
ever as they struggled they bore aloft with them Kai Kaous and the
throne whereon he sat. And so long as their hunger lasted, they strove
after the prey. But at length their strength would hold no longer, and
they desisted from the attempt. And behold! as they desisted the fabric
fell back to earth, and the shock thereof was great. And but for Ormuzd
Kai Kaous would have perished in the presumption of his spirit.

Now the eagles had borne the Shah even unto the desert of Cathay, and
there was no man to succour him, and he suffered from the pangs of
hunger, and there was nothing to assuage his longing, neither could his
thirst be stilled. And he was alone, and sorrowful and shamed in his
soul that he had yet again brought derision upon Iran. And he prayed to
God in his trouble, and entreated pardon for his sins.

While Kai Kaous thus strove with repentance, Rustem learned tidings of
him, and he set out with an army to seek him. And when he had found him
he gave rein unto his anger, and he rebuked him for his follies, and he
said-

"Hath the world seen the like of this man? Hath a more foolish head sat
upon the throne of Iran? Ye would say there were no brains within this
skull, or that not one of its thoughts was good. Kai Kaous is like a
thing that is possessed, and every wind beareth him away. Thrice hast
thou now fallen into mishap, and who can tell whether thy spirit hath
yet learned wisdom? And it will be a reproach unto Iran all her days
that a king puffed up with idle pride was seated upon her throne, a man
who deemed in his folly that he could mount unto the skies, and visit
the sun and moon, and count the stars one by one. I entreat of thee to
bethink thee of thy forefathers, and follow in their steps, and rule the
land in equity, neither rush after these mad adventures."

When Kai Kaous had listened to the bitter words spoken by Rustem, he was
bowed down in his spirit and ashamed before him in his soul. And when at
last he opened his mouth it was to utter words of humility. And he said
unto Rustem-

"Surely that which thou speakest, it is true."

Then he suffered himself to be led back unto his palace, and many days
and nights did he lie in the dust before God, and it was long before he
held him worthy to mount again upon his throne. But when he deemed that
God had forgiven him, he seated him upon it once again. In humility did
he mount it, and he filled it in wisdom. And henceforth he ruled the
land with justice, and he did that which was right in the sight of God,
and bathed his face with the waters of sincerity. And kings and rulers
did homage before him, and forgot the follies that he had done, and Kai
Kaous grew worthy of the throne of light. And Iran was exalted at his
hands, and power and prosperity increased within its borders.
