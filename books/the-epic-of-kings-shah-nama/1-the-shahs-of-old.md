The Shahs of Old
================

Kaiumers first sat upon the throne of Persia, and was master of the
world. He took up his abode in the mountains, and clad himself and his
people in tiger-skins, and from him sprang all kindly nurture and the
arts of clothing, till then unknown. Men and beasts from all parts of
the earth came to do him homage and receive laws at his hands, and his
glory was like to the sun. Then Ahriman the Evil, when he saw how the
Shah's honour was increased, waxed envious, and sought to usurp the
diadem of the world. So he bade his son, a mighty Deev, gather together
an army to go out against Kaiumers and his beloved son Saiamuk and
destroy them utterly.

Now the Serosch, the angel who defendeth men from the snares of the
Deevs, and who each night flieth seven times around the earth that he
may watch over the children of Ormuzd, when he learned this, appeared
like unto a Peri and warned Kaiumers. So when Saiamuk set forth at the
head of his warriors to meet the army of Ahriman, he knew that he was
contending against a Deev, and he put forth all his strength. But the
Deev was mightier than he, and overcame him, and crushed him under his
hands.

When Kaiumers heard the news of mourning, he was bowed to the ground.
For a year did he weep without ceasing, and his army wept with him; yea,
even the savage beasts and the birds of the air joined in the wailing.
And sorrow reigned in the land, and all the world was darkened until the
Serosch bade the Shah lift his head and think on vengeance. And Kaiumers
obeyed, and commanded Husheng, the son of Saiamuk, "Take the lead of the
army, and march against the Deevs." And the King, by reason of his great
age, went in the rear. Now there were in the host Peris; also tigers,
lions, wolves, and other fierce creatures, and when the black Deev heard
their roaring he trembled for very fear. Neither could he hold himself
against them, and Husheng routed him utterly. Then when Kaiumers saw
that his well-beloved son was revenged he laid him down to die, and the
world was void of him, and Husheng reigned in his stead.

Now Husheng was a wise man and just, and the heavens revolved over his
throne forty years. justice did he spread over the land, and the world
was better for his reign. For he first gave to men fire, and showed them
how to draw it from out the stone; and he taught them how they might
lead the rivers, that they should water the land and make it fertile;
and he bade them till and reap. And he divided the beasts and paired
them and gave them names. And when he passed to a brighter life he left
the world empty of a throne of power. But Tahumers, his son, was not
unworthy of his sire. He too opened the eyes of men, and they learned to
spin and to weave; and he reigned over the land long and mightily. But
of him also were the Deevs right envious, and sought to destroy him. Yet
Tahumers overcame them and cast them to earth. Then some craved mercy at
his hands, and sware how they would show him an art if he would spare
them, and Tahumers listened to their voice. And they taught him the art
of writing, and thus from the evil Deevs came a boon upon mankind.

Howbeit when Tahumers had sat upon the golden throne for the space of
thirty years he passed away, but his works endured; and Jemshid, his
glorious son, whose heart was filled with the counsels of his father,
came after him. Now Jemshid reigned over the land seven hundred years
girt with might, and Deevs, birds, and Peris obeyed him. And the world
was happier for his sake, and he too was glad, and death was unknown
among men, neither did they wot of pain or sorrow. And he first
parcelled out men into classes; priests, warriors, artificers, and
husbandmen did he name them. And the year also he divided into periods.
And by aid of the Deevs he raised mighty works, and Persepolis was
builded by him, that to this day is called Tukht-e-Jemsheed, which being
interpreted meaneth the throne of Jemshid. Then, when these things were
accomplished, men flocked from all corners of the earth around his
throne to do him homage and pour gifts before his face. And Jemshid
prepared a feast, and bade them keep it, and called it Neurouz, which is
the New Day, and the people of Persia keep it to this hour. And
Jemshid's power increased, and the world was at peace, and men beheld in
him nought but what was good.

Then it came about that the heart of Jemshid was uplifted in pride, and
he forgot whence came his weal and the source of his blessings. He
beheld only himself upon the earth, and he named himself God, and sent
forth his image to be worshipped. But when he had spoken thus, the
Mubids, which are astrologers and wise men, hung their heads in sorrow,
and no man knew how he should answer the Shah. And God withdrew his hand
from Jemshid, and the kings and the nobles rose up against him, and
removed their warriors from his court, and Ahriman had power over the
land.

Now there dwelt in the deserts of Arabia a king named Mirtas, generous
and just, and he had a son, Zohak, whom he loved. And it came about that
Ahriman visited the palace disguised as a noble, and tempted Zohak that
he should depart from the paths of virtue. And he spake unto him and
said-

"If thou wilt listen to me, and enter into a covenant, I will raise thy
head above the sun."

Now the young man was guileless and simple of heart, and he sware unto
the Deev that he would obey him in all things. Then Ahriman bade him
slay his father, "for this old man," he said, "cumbereth the ground, and
while he liveth thou wilt remain unknown." When Zohak heard this he was
filled with grief, and would have broken his oath, but Ahriman suffered
him not, but made him set a trap for Mirtas. And Zohak and the evil
Ahriman held their peace and Mirtas fell into the snare and was killed.
Then Zohak placed the crown of Thasis upon his head, and Ahriman taught
him the arts of magic, and he ruled over his people in good and evil,
for he was not yet wholly given up to guile.

Then Ahriman imagined a device in his black heart. He took upon himself
the form of a youth, and craved that he might serve the King as cook.
And Zohak, who knew him not, received him well and granted his request,
and the keys of the kitchen were given unto him. Now hitherto men had
been nourished with herbs, but Ahriman prepared flesh for Zohak. New
dishes did he put before him, and the royal favour was accorded to his
savory meats. And the flesh gave the King courage and strength like to
that of a lion, and he commanded that his cook should be brought before
him and ask a boon at his hands. And the cook said-

"If the King take pleasure in his servant, grant that he may kiss his
shoulders."

Now Zohak, who feared no evil, granted the request, and Ahriman kissed
him on his shoulders. And when he had done so, the ground opened beneath
his feet and covered the cook, so that all men present were amazed
thereat. But from his kiss sprang hissing serpents, venomous and black;
and the King was afraid, and desired that they should be cut off from
the root. But as often as the snakes were cut down did they grow again,
and in vain the wise men and physicians cast about for a remedy. Then
Ahriman came once again disguised as a learned man, and was led before
Zohak, and he spake, saying-

"This ill cannot be healed, neither can the serpents be uprooted.
Prepare food for them, therefore, that they may be fed, and give unto
them for nourishment the brains of men, for perchance this may destroy
them."

But in his secret heart Ahriman desired that the world might thus be
made desolate; and daily were the serpents fed, and the fear of the King
was great in the land. The world withered in his thrall, the customs of
good men were forgotten, and the desires of the wicked were
accomplished.

Now it was spread abroad in Iran that in the land of Thasis there
reigned a man who was mighty and terrible to his foes. Then the kings
and nobles who had withdrawn from Jemshid because he had rebelled
against God, turned to Zohak and besought him that he would be their
ruler, and they proclaimed him Shah. And the armies of Arabia and Persia
marched against Jemshid, and he fled before their face. For the space of
twice fifty years no man knew whither he was gone, for he hid from the
wrath of the Serpent-King. But in the fulness of time he could no longer
escape the fury of Zohak, whose servants found him as he wandered on the
sea-shore of Cathay, and they sawed him in twain, and sent tidings
thereof to their lord. And thus perished the throne and power of Jemshid
like unto the grass that withereth, because that he was grown proud, and
would have lifted himself above his Maker.

So the beloved of Ahriman, Zohak the Serpent, sat upon the throne of
Iran, the kingdom of Light. And he continued to pile evil upon evil till
the measure thereof was full to overflowing, and all the land cried out
against him. But Zohak and his councillors, the Deevs, shut ear unto
this cry, and the Shah reigned thus for the space of a thousand years,
and vice stalked in daylight, but virtue was hidden. And despair filled
all hearts, for it was as though mankind must perish to still the
appetite of those snakes sprung from Evil, for daily were two men
slaughtered to satisfy their desire. Neither had Zohak mercy upon any
man. And darkness was spread over the land because of his wickedness.

But Ormuzd saw it and was moved with compassion for his people, and he
declared they should no longer suffer for the sin of Jemshid. And he
caused a grandson to be born to Jemshid, and his parents called him
Feridoun.

Now it befell that when he was born, Zohak dreamed he beheld a youth
slender like to a cypress, and he came towards him bearing a cow-headed
mace, and with it he struck Zohak to the ground. Then the tyrant awoke
and trembled, and called for his Mubids, that they should interpret to
him this dream. And they were troubled, for they foresaw danger, and he
menaced them if they foretold him evil. And they were silent for fear
three days, but on the fourth one who had courage spake and said-

"There will arise one named Feridoun, who shall inherit thy throne and
reverse thy fortunes, and strike thee down with a cow-headed mace."

When Zohak heard these words he swooned, and the Mubids fled before his
wrath. But when he had recovered he bade the world be scoured for
Feridoun. And henceforth Zohak was consumed for bitterness of spirit,
and he knew neither rest nor joy.

Now it came about that the mother of Feridoun feared lest the Shah
should destroy the child if he learned that he was sprung from Jemshid's
race. So she hid him in the thick forest where dwelt the wondrous cow
Purmaieh, whose hairs were like unto the plumes of a peacock for beauty.
And she prayed the guardian of Purmaieh to have a care of her son, and
for three years he was reared in the wood, and Purmaieh was his nurse.
But when the time was accomplished the mother knew that news of Purmaieh
had reached the ears of Zohak, and she feared he would find her son.
Therefore she took him far into Ind, to a pious hermit who dwelt on the
Mount Alberz. And she prayed the hermit to guard her boy, who was
destined for mighty deeds. And the hermit granted her request. And it
befell that while she sojourned with him Zohak had found the beauteous
Purmaieh and learned of Feridoun, and when he heard that the boy was
fled he was like unto a mad elephant in his fury. He slew the wondrous
cow and all the living things round about, and made the forest a desert.
Then he continued his search, but neither tidings nor sight could he get
of Feridoun, and his heart was filled with anguish.

In this year Zohak caused his army to be strengthened, and he demanded
of his people that they should certify that he had ever been to them a
just and noble king. And they obeyed for very fear. But while they sware
there arose without the doorway of the Shah the cry of one who demanded
justice. And Zohak commanded that he should be brought in, and the man
stood before the assembly of the nobles.

Then Zohak opened his mouth and said, "I charge thee give a name unto
him who hath done thee wrong."

And the man, when he saw it was the Shah who questioned him, smote his
head with his hands. But he answered and said-

"I am Kawah, a blacksmith and a blameless man, and I sue for justice,
and it is against thee, O King, that I cry out. Seventeen fair sons have
I called mine, yet only one remaineth to me, for that his brethren were
slain to still the hunger of thy serpents, and now they have taken from
me this last child also. I pray thee spare him unto me, nor heap thy
cruelties upon the land past bearing."

And the Shah feared Kawah's wrath, beholding that it was great, and he
granted him the life of his son and sought to win him with soft words.
Then he prayed him that he would also sign the testimony that Zohak was
a just and noble king.

But Kawah cried, "Not so, thou wicked and ignoble man, ally of Deevs, I
will not lend my hand unto this lie," and he seized the declaration and
tore it into fragments and scattered them into the air. And when he had
done so he strode forth from the palace, and all the nobles and people
were astonished, so that none dared uplift a finger to restrain him.
Then Kawah went to the market-place and related to the people all that
which he had seen, and recalled to them the evil deeds of Zohak and the
wrongs they had suffered at his hands. And he provoked them to shake off
the yoke of Ahriman. And taking off the leathern apron wherewith
blacksmiths cover their knees when they strike with the hammer, he
raised it aloft upon the point of a lance and cried-

"Be this our banner to march forth and seek out Feridoun and entreat him
that he deliver us from out the hands of the Serpent-King."

Then the people set up a shout of joy and gathered themselves round
Kawah, and he led them out of the city bearing aloft his standard. And
they marched thus for many days unto the palace of Feridoun.

Now these things came about in the land of Iran after twice eight years
were passed over the head of Feridoun. And when that time was
accomplished, he descended from the Mount Alberz and sought out his
mother, questioning her of his lineage. And she told him how that he was
sprung from the race of Jemshid, and also of Zohak and of his evil
deeds.

Then said Feridoun, "I will uproot this monster from the earth, and his
palace will I raze to the dust."

But his mother spake, and said, "Not so, my son, let not thine youthful
anger betray thee; for how canst thou stand against all the world?"

Yet not long did she suffer the hard task to hinder him, for soon a
mighty crowd came towards the palace led by one who bare an apron
uplifted upon a lance. Then Feridoun knew that succour was come unto
him. And when he had listened to Kawah, he came into the presence of his
mother with the helmet of kings upon his head, and he said unto her-

"Mother, I go to the wars, and it remaineth for thee to pray God for my
safety."

Then he caused a mighty club to be made for him, and he traced the
pattern thereof upon the ground, and the top thereof was the head of a
cow, in memory of Purmaieh, his nurse. Then he cased the standard of
Kawah in rich brocades of Roum, and hung jewels upon it. And when all
was made ready, they set forth towards the West to seek out Zohak, for,
they knew not that he was gone to Ind in search of Feridoun. Now when
they were come to Bagdad, which is upon the banks of the Tigris, they
halted, and Feridoun bade the guardians of the flood convey them across.
But these refused, saying, the King bade that none should pass save only
those who bore the royal seal. When Feridoun heard these words he was
wroth, and he regarded not the rushing river nor the dangers hidden
within its floods. He girded his loins and plunged with his steed into
the waters, and all the army followed after him. Now they struggled sore
with the rushing stream, and it seemed as though the waves would bear
them down. But their brave horses overcame all dangers, and they stepped
in safety upon the shore. Then they turned their faces towards the city
which is now called Jerusalem, for here stood the glorious house that
Zohak had builded. And when they had entered the city all the people
rallied round Feridoun, for they hated Zohak and looked to Feridoun to
deliver them. And he slew the Deevs that held the palace, and cast down
the evil talisman that was graven upon the walls. Then he mounted the
throne of the idolater and placed the crown of Iran upon his head, and
all the people bowed down before him and called him Shah.

Now when Zohak returned from his search after Feridoun and learned that
he was seated upon his throne, he encompassed the city with his host.
But the army of Feridoun marched against him, and the desires of the
people went with them. And all that day bricks fell from the walls and
stones from the terraces, and it rained arrows and spears like to hail
falling from a dark cloud, until Feridoun had overcome the might of
Zohak. Then Feridoun raised his cow-headed mace to slay the
Serpent-King. But the blessed Serosch swooped down, and cried-

"Not so, strike not, for Zohak's hour is not yet come."

Then the Serosch bade the Shah bind the usurper and carry him far from
the haunts of men, and there fasten him to a rock. And Feridoun did as
he was bidden, and led forth Zohak to the Mount Demawend. And he bound
him to the rock with mighty chains and nails driven into his hands, and
left him to perish in agony. And the hot sun shone down upon the barren
cliffs, and there was neither tree nor shrub to shelter him, and the
chains entered into his flesh, and his tongue was consumed with thirst.
Thus after a while the earth was delivered of Zohak the evil one, and
Feridoun reigned in his stead.
