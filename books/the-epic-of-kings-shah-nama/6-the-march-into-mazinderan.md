The March into Mazinderan
=========================

Kai aous seated him on the crystal throne, and the world was obedient to
his will. But Ahriman was angry that his power was so long broken in
Iran, and he sware unto himself that happiness should no longer smile
upon the land. And he imagined guile in his black heart.

Now it came about one day that the Shah sat in his trellised bower in
the garden of roses, drinking wine and making merry with his court. Then
Ahriman, when he beheld that they were thus forgetful of care, saw that
the time served him. So he sent forth a Deev clad as a singer, and bade
him ask for audience before the Shah. And the Deev did as he was bidden.
And he came before the servants of the King, and begged for entrance
into the arbour of flowers.

"For verily," he said, "I am a singer of sweet songs, and I come from
Mazinderan, and desire to pour my homage at the throne of my lord."

Now when Kai Kaous learned that a singer waited without, he commanded
that he should be brought in. Then he gave him wine and permitted him to
open his mouth before him. Now the Deev, when he had done homage before
the Shah, warbled unto his lyre words of deep cunning. And he sang how
that no land was like unto his own for beauty and riches, and he
inflamed the desires of the Shah after Mazinderan. And Ahriman fanned
the flame within the mind of the King, and when the Deev had ended, Kai
Kaous was become uplifted in his heart, like unto Jemshid. So he turned
him unto his warriors and said-

"O my friends, mighty and brave, we have abandoned ourselves unto
feasting, we have revelled in the arms of peace. But it behoveth not men
to live long in this wise, lest they grow idle and weak. And above all
it behoveth not me that am a Shah, for the Shah is called to be a hero
among men, and the world should be his footstool. Now verily the power
and splendour of Jemshid was lower than mine, and my wealth surpasseth
that of Zohak and Kai Kobad. It beseemeth me therefore to be greater
also than they in prowess, and to be master of Mazinderan, which ever
resisted their might. I bid you therefore make ready for combat, and I
will lead you into the land whereof this singer hath sung so sweetly."

Now the nobles, when they had heard these words, grew pale with fear,
for there was not one among them who listed to combat with Deevs. But
none durst open their lips in answer, yet their hearts were full of fear
and their mouths of sighs. But at last, when they could keep silence no
longer, some spake and said-

"Lord, we are thy servants, and that which thou biddest surely we must
do."

But among themselves they took counsel how they should act if the Shah
held firm by his desire. And they recalled how not even Jemshid in his
pride had thought to conquer the Deevs of Mazinderan, before whom the
sword hath no power and wisdom no avail, neither had Feridoun, learned
in magic, or Minuchihr the mighty, ventured on this emprise. Then they
bethought them of Zal the son of Saum, and they sent forth a wind-footed
dromedary and a messenger. And they said unto Zal-

"Haste, we pray thee, neither tarry to cleanse thine head though it be
covered with dust; for Ahriman hath strown evil seed in the heart of Kai
Kaous, and it ripeneth to fruit already, and already it hath borne
fruit, and Iran is threatened with danger. But we look to thee that thou
speak words of good counsel unto the Shah, and avert these sorrows from
our heads."

Now Zal was sore distressed when he learned that a leaf on the tree of
the Kaianides was thus faded. And he said-

"Kai Kaous is void of knowledge, and the sun must revolve yet oft above
his head before he learneth the wisdom of the great. For unto true
wisdom alone is it given to know when to strike and when to tarry. But
he is like unto a child who deemeth the world will tremble if it but
upraiseth its sword. And but for my duty unto God and unto Iran, I would
abandon him to his folly."

Then Zal revolved in his mind this trouble even until the sun was set.
But when the glory of the world was arisen yet again, he girt his sash
about his loins, and took in his hand the mace of might and set forth
unto the throne of the Shah. And he craved for audience, and prostrated
himself before the King. And when Kai Kaous permitted it, Zal opened his
mouth and spake words of wisdom. And he said-

"O King powerful and great, word is come unto me, even unto Seistan, of
thy device. But it seemeth unto me that mine ears have not heard aright.
For Mazinderan is the abode of Deevs, and no man can overcome their
skill. Give not, therefore, unto the wind thy men and thy treasures.
Turn, I pray thee, from this scheme, neither plant in the garden of Iran
the tree of folly, whose leaves are curses and whose fruits are evil,
for thus did not the kings before thee."

Then Kai Kaous, when he had listened, said, "I despise not thy counsel,
nor do I bid thee hold thy peace, for thou art a pillar unto Iran. But
neither shall thy words divert me from my desire, and Mazinderan shall
pay tribute to my hands. For thou considerest not how that my heart is
bolder and my might more great than that of my fathers before me. I go,
therefore, and the kingdom will I leave between thy hands and those of
Rustem thy son."

When Zal heard these words, and beheld that Kai Kaous was firm in his
purpose, he ceased from opposing. Then he bowed him unto the dust, and
spake, saying-

"O Shah, it is thine to command, and whether it be just or unjust, thy
servants serve thee even unto death. I have spoken the words that
weighed upon my heart. Three things it is not given to do, even unto a
king: to elude death, to bind up the eye of destiny, to live without
nurture. Mayst thou never repent thee of thy resolve, mayst thou never
regret my counsels in the hour of danger, may the might of the Shah
shine for ever!"

And when he had ended, Zal went out of the presence of the King, and he
was right sorrowful, and the nobles mourned with him when they learned
how nought had been accomplished.

Then, ere the day succeeded unto the night, Kai Kaous set forth with his
horsemen unto Mazinderan.

Now when they were come within its borders, Kai Kaous commanded Gew that
he should choose forth a strong band from out their midst, and go before
the city with mighty clubs. And he bade him destroy the dwellers of the
town, neither should they spare the women nor the young, because that
they too were the children of Deevs. And Gew did as the Shah commanded.
Then clubs rained down upon the people like to hail, and the city that
resembled a garden was changed into a desert, and all the inmates
thereof perished at the hands of the enemy, neither did they find any
mercy in their eyes. But when the men of Iran had ceased from killing,
they sent news thereof unto the Shah, and told him of the riches that
were hidden within the palaces.

And Kai Kaous said, "Blessed be he who sang to me of the glories of this
realm."

And he marched after Gew with the rest of his host, and seven days did
they never cease from plundering, neither could they be sated with the
gold and jewels that they found. But on the eighth the tidings of their
deeds pierced unto the King of Mazinderan, and his heart was heavy with
care. He therefore sent a messenger unto the mountains where dwelt the
White Deev, who was powerful and strong, and he entreated him that he
would come unto his succour, or verily the land would perish under the
feet of Iran.

The White Deev, when he heard the message, uprose like to a mountain in
his strength, and he said-

"Let not the King of Mazinderan be troubled, for surely the hosts of
Iran shall vanish at my approach."

Then, when the night was fallen, he spread a dark cloud, heavy and
thick, over the land, and no light could pierce it, neither could fires
be seen across its midst, and you would have said the world was steeped
in pitch. And the army of Iran was wrapt in a tent of blackness. Then
the Deev caused it to rain stones and javelins, and the Iranians could
not behold their source, neither could they defend themselves or stand
against the arts of magic. And they wandered astray in their distress,
and no man could find his fellow, and their hearts were angered against
the Shah for this emprise. But when the morning was come, and glory was
arisen upon the world, they could not see it, for the light of their
eyes was gone out. And Kai Kaous too was blinded, and he wept sore, and
the whole army wept with him in their anguish. And the Shah cried in his
distress-

"O Zal, O my Pehliva wise and great, wherefore did I shut mine ear unto
thy voice!"

And the army echoed his words in their hearts, but their lips were
silent for boundless sorrow.

Then the White Deev spake unto Kai Kaous with a voice of thunder, and he
said-

"O King, thou hast been struck like to a rotten trunk, on thine own head
alone resteth this destruction, for thou hast attained unto Mazinderan,
and entered the land after which thy heart desired."

And he bade his legion guard the Shah and all his army, and he withheld
from them wine and good cheer, and gave unto them but enough for
sustenance, for he desired not that they should die, but gloried in
their wretchedness. Then when he had so done he sent tidings thereof
unto the King of Mazinderan. And he bade the King take back the booty
and rejoice in the defeat of Iran. And he counselled him that he suffer
not Kai Kaous to perish, that he might learn to know good fortune from
ill. And the White Deev bade the King sing praises unto Ahriman the
mighty, who had sent him unto his aid. And having spoken thus he
returned him unto his home in the mountains, but the King of Mazinderan
rejoiced in his spoils.

Now Kai Kaous remained in the land after which he had yearned, and his
heart was heavy with bitterness. And the eyes of his soul were opened,
and he cried continually, "This fault is mine;" and he cast about in his
spirit how he might release his host from the hands of the Deevs. But
the Deevs guarded him straitly, and he could send no messenger into
Iran. Howbeit it came about that a messenger escaped their borders, and
bore unto Zal the writing of Kai Kaous the afflicted. And Kai Kaous
bowed himself in his spirit unto the dust before Zal, and he wrote to
him all that was come about, and how that he and his host were blind and
captive, and he poured forth his repentance, and he said-

"I have sought what the foolish seek, and found what they find. And if
thou wilt not gird thy loins to succour me, I perish indeed."

When Zal heard this message he gnawed his hands in vexation. Then he
called before him Rustem, and said-

"The hour is come to saddle Rakush and to avenge the world with thy
sword. As for me, I number two hundred years, and have no longer the
strength to fight with Deevs. But thou art young and mighty. Cast about
thee, therefore, thy leopard-skin and deliver Iran from bondage."

And Rustem said, "My sword is ready, and I will go hence as thou dost
bid. Yet of old, O my father, the mighty did not go forth of their own
will to fight the powers of hell, neither doth one who is not weary of
this world go into the mouth of a hungry lion. But if God be with me I
shall overcome the Deevs and gird our army anew with the sashes of
might. And I pray that His blessing rest upon me."

Then Zal, when he heard these noble words, blessed his son, and prayed
that Ormuzd too would give him his blessing. And he bestowed on him wise
counsel, and told him how he could come unto the land of Mazinderan. And
he said-

"Two roads lead unto this kingdom, and both are hard and fraught with
danger. The one taken of Kai Kaous is the safest, but it is long, and it
behoveth vengeance to be fleet. Choose therefore, I charge thee, the
shorter road, though it be beset with baleful things, and may Ormuzd
return thee safe unto mine arms."

When Rustem had drunk in the counsels of his father he seated him on
Rakush the fleet of foot. But when he would have departed, his mother
came out before him, and she made great wailing that Rustem should go
before the evil Deevs. And she would have hindered him, but Rustem
suffered her not. He comforted her with his voice, and bade her be of
good cheer. He showed unto her how that he had not of his own choice
chosen this adventure. And he bade her rest her hopes in God. And when
he had done speaking she let him depart, but the heart of Rudabeh
yearned after her son, and her eyes were red with weeping many days.

In the meanwhile the young hero of the world sped forth to do his duty
unto the Shah. And Rakush caused the ground to vanish under his feet,
and in twelve hours was a two days' journey accomplished. Then when eve
was fallen, Rustem ensnared a wild ass, and made a fire and roasted it
for his meal. And when he had done he released Rakush from the bonds of
his saddle and prepared for himself a couch among the reeds, neither was
he afraid of wild beasts or of Deevs.

But in the reeds was hidden the lair of a fierce lion, and the lion when
he returned unto his haunt beheld the tall man and the horse that
watched beside him. And he rejoiced at the fat meal that he held was in
store. And he thought within his mind, "I will first subdue the steed,
then the rider will be an easy prey." And he fell upon Rakush. But
Rakush defended himself mightily. With his hoofs did he trample upon the
forehead of the lion, with his sharp teeth did he tear his skin, and he
trampled upon him till he died. But the noise of the struggle had
wakened Rustem, and when he beheld the body of the lion, and Rakush
standing beside it, he knew what had been done. Then he opened his mouth
in reproof, and said-

"O thoughtless steed, who bade thee combat lions? Wherefore didst thou
not wake me? for if thou hadst been overcome, who, I pray thee, could
have borne my weight into Mazinderan, whither I must hie me to deliver
the Shah?

When he had thus spoken he turned again to sleep, but Rakush was
sorrowful and downcast in his spirit.

Now when morn was come they set forth once again upon their travels. And
all day long they passed through a desert, and the pitiless sun burned
down upon their heads, and the sand was living fire, and the steed and
rider were like to perish of thirst, and nowhere could Rustem find the
traces of water. So he made him ready to die, and commended his soul
unto God, and prayed Him to remember Kai Kaous, His servant, nor abandon
him in his distress. Then he laid him down to await the end. But lo!
when he thought it was come, there passed before him a ram, well
nourished and fat. And Rustem said unto himself-

"Surely the watering-place of this beast cannot be distant."

Then he roused him and led Rakush and followed in the footsteps of the
ram, and behold, it led him unto a spring of water, cool and clear. And
Rustem drank thereof with greed, and he gave unto Rakush, and bathed him
in the waters, and when they were both refreshed he sought for the
traces of the ram. And they were nowhere to be found. Then Rustem knew
that Ormuzd had wrought a wonder for his sake, and he fell upon the
ground and lifted up his soul in thankfulness. Then when he had caught
and eaten a wild ass, he laid him down to slumber. And he spake and said
unto Rakush-

"I charge thee, O my steed, that thou seek no strife during my slumbers.
If an enemy cometh before thee, come unto me and neigh beside mine ear,
and verily I will waken and come to thine aid."

And Rakush listened, and when he saw that Rustem slumbered, he gambolled
and grazed beside him. But when some watches of the night were spent,
there came forth an angry dragon whose home was in this spot, a dragon
fierce and fiery, whom even the Deevs dared not encounter. And when he
beheld Rakush and Rustem he was astonished that a man should slumber
softly beside his lair. And he came towards them with his breath of
poison. Then Rakush, when he saw it, stamped his hoofs upon the ground
and beat the air with his tail, so that the noise thereof resounded
wide, and Rustem was awakened with the din. And he was angry with Rakush
that he had wakened him, for the dragon had vanished, and he could see
no cause for fear. And he said-

"It is thy fault, O unkind steed, that slumber is fled from me."

Then he turned him to sleep once again. But when the dragon saw it he
came forth once more, and once more did Rakush wake Rustem, and once
more did the dragon vanish ere the eyes of Rustem were opened. And when
Rakush had thus awakened the hero yet three times, Rustem was beside him
with anger, and wisdom departed from its dwelling. He piled reproaches
upon the horse, and hurled bitter words upon his head, and he sware that
if he acted thus again he would slay him with his arm of power, and
would wander on foot unto Mazinderan. And he said-

"I bade thee call upon me if dangers menaced, but thou sufferest me not
to slumber when all is well."

Then Rustem drew his leopard-skin about him and laid him down again to
sleep. But Rakush was pained in his spirit, and pawed the ground in his
vexation. Then the dragon came forth yet again, and was about to fall
upon Rakush, and the steed was sore distressed how he should act. But he
took courage and came beside Rustem once more, and stamped upon the
ground and neighed and woke him. And Rustem sprang up in fury, but this
time it was given unto him to behold the dragon, and he knew that Rakush
had done that which was right. And he drew his armour about him and
unsheathed his sword, and came forth to meet the fiery beast. Then the
dragon said-

"What is thy name, and who art thou that dost venture against me? for
verily the woman that bore thee shall weep."

And the Pehliva answered, "I am Rustem, of the seed of Zal, and in
myself I am an host, and none can withstand my might."

But the dragon laughed at his words, and held them to be vain boasting.
Then he fell upon Rustem, the son of Zal, and he wound himself about his
body, and would have crushed him with his writhings, and you would have
said that the end of this hero was come. But Rakush, when he beheld the
straits of his master, sprang upon the dragon from the rear, and he tore
him as he had torn the lion, and Rustem pierced the beast with his
sword, and between them the world was delivered of this scourge. Then
Rustem was glad, and he praised Rakush, and washed him at the fountain,
and gave thanks to God who had given unto him the victory. And when he
had so done he sprang into his saddle, and rode until they were come
unto the land of the magicians.

Now when evening was fallen over the land they came unto a green and
shady vale, and a brook ran through it, and cool woods clothed its
sides. And beside a spring there was spread a table, and wine and all
manner of good cheer stood thereon. And Rustem, when he saw it, loosened
his saddle and bade Rakush graze and drink, and he seated him beside the
table and enjoyed its fare. And his spirit laughed with pleasure that he
had found a table ready dressed within the desert, for he knew not that
it was the table of the magicians, who were fled on his approach. And he
ate and drank, and when he had stilled his hunger he took up a lyre that
lay beside him, and he lilted to it in his ease of heart. And he sang-

"Rustem is the scourge of the base, Not for him were pleasures meant;
Rare are his feasts and holidays, His garden is the desert place, The
battlefield his tournament.

"There the sword of Rustem cleaves Not the armour of jousting knights,
But the skulls of dragons and Deevs; Nor shall Rustem, as he believes,
Ever be quit of the foes he fights.

"Cups of wine and wreaths of rose, Gardens where cool arbours stand,
Fortune gave such gifts as those Not to Rustem, but hurtling foes,
Strife, and a warrior's heart and hand."

Now the song of Rustem was come to the ears of one of the witches, and
she changed herself into a damsel with a face of spring. And she came
before Rustem and asked him his name, and toyed with him, and he was
pleased with her company. And he poured out wine and handed it unto her,
and bade her drink unto Ormuzd. But the magician, when she heard the
name of God, fell into a tremble and her visage changed, and Rustem
beheld her in all her vileness. Then his quick spirit knew her for what
she was, and he made a noose and caught her in his snare, and severed
her in twain. And all the magicians, when they saw it, were afraid, and
none durst come forth to meet the hero. But Rustem straightway departed
from this spot.

And Rustem rode till that he was come unto a land where the sun never
shineth, neither stars lighten the blackness, and he could not see his
path. So he suffered Rakush to lead him at his will. And they stumbled
along amid the blackness, but at the end they came out again into the
light. And Rustem beheld a land that was swathed in verdure, and fields
wherein the crops were sprouting. Then he loosened Rakush and bade him
graze, and laid himself down to slumber awhile.

Now Rakush went forth to graze in a field that had been sown, and the
guardian thereof, when he saw it, was angry, and ran unto the spot where
Rustem was couched, and beat the soles of his feet with a stick and woke
him. And he flung reproaches and evil words upon him for that his horse
was broken into the pastures. Then Rustem was angry, and fell upon the
man, and took him by the ears and tore them from his body. And the man
fled, howling in his agony, and came before Aulad, the ruler of the
land, and laid his plaints before him. And Aulad also was angry, and
went forth to seek Rustem, and demand his name and mission, and
wherefore he had thus disturbed their peace. And Aulad sware that he
would destroy him for this deed.

Then Rustem answered, "I am the thunder-cloud that sendeth forth
lightnings, and none can stand before my strength. But if thou shouldest
hear my name, the blood would stand still within thy veins. Thou art
come against me with an host, see therefore how I shall scatter them
like the wind."

And when he had thus spoken, Rustem fell upon the warriors of Aulad, and
he beat them down before him, and their heads fell under the blows of
his sword of death. And the army was routed at the hands of one man. Now
Aulad, when he saw it, wept and fled; but Rustem pursued him, and threw
his noose about him, and caught him in the snare. And the world became
dark unto Aulad. Then Rustem bound him, and threw him on the ground, and
said-

"If thou speak unto me that which is true, verily I will release thee;
and when I shall have overcome the Deevs, I will give the land of
Mazinderan into thy hands. Tell me, therefore, where dwelleth the White
Deev, and where may I find the Shah and his men, and how can I deliver
them from bondage?"

Then Aulad answered and told Rustem how it was an hundred farsangs unto
the spot where Kai Kaous groaned in his bondage, and how it was yet
another hundred unto the mountain pass where dwelt the Deev. And he told
him how the passes were guarded by lions and magicians and mighty men,
and how none had ever pierced thereunto. And he counselled him to desist
from this quest.

But Rustem smiled, and said, "Be thou my guide, and thou wilt behold an
elephant overcome the might of evil."

And when he had thus spoken he sprang upon Rakush, and Aulad in his
bonds ran after him, and they sped like the wind, neither did they halt
by night or day till they were come unto the spot where Kai Kaous had
been smitten by the Deevs. And when they were come there they could
behold the watch-fires of Mazinderan. Then Rustem laid him down to
sleep, and he tied Aulad unto a tree that he should not escape him. But
when the sun was risen he laid the mace of Saum before his saddle, and
rode with gladness towards the city of the Deevs.

Now when Rustem was come nigh unto the tents of Arzang, that led the
army of Mazinderan, he uttered a cry that rent the mountains. And the
cry brought forth Arzang from out his tent, and when he perceived Rustem
he ran at him, and would have thrown him down. But Rustem sprang upon
Arzang, and he seemed an insect in his grasp. And he overcame him, and
parted his head from his body, and hung it upon his saddlebow in
triumph. And fear came upon the army of Mazinderan when they saw it, and
they fled in faintness of spirit, and so great was the confusion that
none beheld whither he bent his steps. And fathers fell upon sons, and
brothers upon brothers, and dismay was spread throughout the land.

Then Rustem loosened the bonds of Aulad, and bade him lead him into the
city where Kai Kaous pined in his bondage. And Aulad led him. Now when
they neared the city, Rakush neighed so loud that the sound pierced even
unto the spot where Kai Kaous was hidden. And the Shah, when he heard
it, rejoiced, for he knew that succour was come. And he told it unto his
comrades. But they refused to listen unto these words, and deemed that
grief had distraught his wits. In vain therefore did Kai Kaous insist
unto them that his ears had heard the voice of Rakush. But not long did
he combat their unbelief, for presently there came before him Tehemten,
the stout of limb, and when the nobles heard his voice and his step they
repented them of their doubts. And Kai Kaous embraced Rustem and blessed
him, and questioned him of his journey and of Zal. Then he said-

"O my Pehliva, we may no longer waste the moments with sweet words. I
must send thee forth yet again to battle. For when the White Deev shall
learn that Arzang is defeated, he will come forth from out his mountain
fastness, and bring with him the whole multitude of evil ones, and even
thy might will not stand before them. Go therefore unto the Seven
Mountains, and conquer the White Deev ere the tidings reach him of thy
coming. Unto thee alone can Iran look for her succour, for I cannot aid
thee, neither can my warriors assist thee with their arms, for our eyes
are filled with darkness, and their light is gone out. Yet I grieve to
send thee into this emprise alone, for I have heard it spoken that the
dwelling of the Deevs is a spot of fear and terror, but alas! my grief
is of no avail. And I conjure thee, slay the Deev, and bring unto me the
blood of his heart, for a Mubid hath revealed unto me that only by this
blood can our sight be restored. And go forth now, my son, and may
Ormuzd be gracious unto thee, and may the tree of gladness sprout again
for Iran!

Then Rustem did as Kai Kaous commanded, and he rode forth, and Aulad
went beside him to lead him in the way. And when they had passed the
Seven Mountains and were come unto the gates of hell, Rustem spake unto
Aulad, and said-

"Thou hast ever led me aright, and all that thou hast spoken I have
surely found it true. Tell me, therefore, now how I shall vanquish the
Deevs."

And Aulad said, "Tarry, I counsel thee, till that the sun be high in the
heavens. For when it beateth fierce upon the earth the Deevs are wont to
lay them down to slumber, and when they are drunk with sleep they shall
fall an easy prey into thine hands."

Then Rustem did as Aulad bade him, and he halted by the roadside, and he
bound Aulad from head to foot in his snare, and he seated himself upon
the ends. But when the sun was high he drew forth his sword from out its
sheath, and shouted loud his name, and flung it among the Deevs like to
a thunderbolt. Then before they were well awakened from their sleep, he
threw himself upon them, and none could resist him, and he scattered
their heads with his sword. And when he had dispersed the guards he came
unto the lair of the White Deev.

Then Rustem stepped within the rocky tomb wherein the Deev was hidden,
and the air was murky and heavy with evil odours, and the Pehliva could
not see his path. But he went on void of fear, though the spot was
fearful and dangers lurked in its sides. And when he was come unto the
end of the cave he found a great mass like to a mountain, and it was the
Deev in his midday slumber. Then Rustem woke him, and the Deev was
astonished at his daring, and sprang at the hero, and threw a great
stone like a small mountain upon him. And Rustem's heart trembled, and
he said unto himself, "If I escape to-day, I shall live for ever." And
he fell on the Deev, and they struggled hot and sore, and the Deev tore
Rustem, but Rustem defended himself, and they wrestled with force till
that the blood and sweat ran down in rivers from their bodies. Then
Rustem prayed to God, and God heard him and gave him strength, and in
the end Rustem overcame the White Deev and slew him. And he severed his
head from his trunk, and cut his heart from out his midst.

Then Rustem returned him unto Aulad and told him what he had done. And
Aulad said-

"O brave lion, who hast vanquished the world with thy sword, release
now, I pray thee, this thy servant, for thy snare is entered into my
flesh. And suffer that I recall to thee how that thou hast promised to
me a recompense, and surely thou wilt fulfil thy word."

And Rustem answered and said, "Ay, verily; but I have yet much to do ere
that my mission be ended. For I have still to conquer the King of
Mazinderan; but when these things shall be accomplished, in truth I will
fulfil my words unto thee."

Then he bade Aulad follow him, and they retraced their steps until they
were come unto the spot where Kai Kaous was held in bondage. And when
Kai Kaous learned that Rustem was returned with victory upon his brow he
shouted for joy, and all the host shouted with him, and they could not
contain themselves for happiness. And they called down the blessings of
Heaven upon the head of Rustem. But when the hero came before them, he
took of the blood of the White Deev and poured it into their eyes, and
the eyes of Kai Kaous and his men were opened, and they once again
beheld the glory of the day. Then they swept the ground around them with
fire, with swords they overcame their gaolers. But when they had
finished, Kai Kaous bade them desist from further bloodshed.

Then Kai Kaous wrote a letter unto the King of Mazinderan, and he
counselled him that he should conclude a peace. And he related to him
how that his mainstay was broken, for Rustem had overcome Arzang and
slain the White Deev. And he said that Rustem would slay him also if he
should not submit unto Iran and pay tribute to its Shah. Then Kai Kaous
sent a messenger with this writing unto the King of Mazinderan.

Now the King, when he had read the letter, and learned how that Arzang
and the White Deev and all his train were slain, was sore troubled, and
he paled in his spirit, and it seemed to him that the sun of his glory
was about to set. Howbeit he suffered not the messenger to behold his
distress, but wrote haughty words unto Kai Kaous, and dared him to come
forth to meet him. And he boasted of his might and reproached Kai Kaous
with his folly. And he threatened that he would raze Iran unto the dust.

When Kai Kaous had read this answer he was wroth, and his nobles with
him. And Rustem spake and said-

"Permit me, O my Shah, that I go forth before the King of Mazinderan,
and intrust unto me yet another writing."

Then Kai Kaous sent for a scribe, and the scribe cut a reed like to the
point of an arrow, and he wrote with it the words that Kai Kaous
dictated. And Kai Kaous made not many words. He bade the King lay aside
his arrogance, and he warned him of the fate that would await his
disobedience, and he said unto him that if he listened not he might hang
his severed head on the walls of his own city. Then he signed the letter
with his royal seal, and Rustem bore it forth from the camp.

Now when the King of Mazinderan learned that Kai Kaous sent him yet
another messenger, he bade the flower of his army go forth to meet him.
And Rustem, when he saw them come near, laid hold upon a tree of great
stature and spreading branches that grew by the wayside. And he uprooted
the tree from the earth, and brandished it in his hands like to a
javelin. And those that saw it were amazed at his strength. Then Rustem,
when he beheld their awe, flung the tree among them, and many a brave
man was dismounted by this mace. Then there stepped forth from the midst
of the host one of the giants of Mazinderan, and he begged that he might
grasp Rustem by the hand. And when he had hold of the hand of the
Pehliva he pressed it with all his might, for he thought that he could
wring off this hand of valour. But Rustem smiled at the feebleness of
his grasp, and he grasped him in return, and the giant grew pale, and
the veins started forth upon his hands.

Then one set off to tell the King what he had seen. And the King sent
forth his doughtiest knight, and bade him retrieve the honour of their
strength. And Kalahour the knight said-

"Verily so will I do, and I will force the tears of pain from the eyes
of this messenger."

And he came towards Rustem and wrung his hand, and his gripe was like to
a vise, and Rustem felt the pang thereof, and he winced in his
suffering. But he would not let the men of Mazinderan glory in his
triumph. He took the hand of Kalahour in his own, and grasped it and
crushed it till that the blood issued from its veins and the nails fell
from off its fingers. Then Kalahour turned him and went before the Shah
and showed unto him his hand. And he counselled him to make peace with
the land that could send forth such messengers whose might none could
withstand. But the King was loath to sue for peace, and he commanded
that the messenger be brought before him.

Then the elephant-bodied stood before the King of Mazinderan. And the
King questioned him of his journey, and of Kai Kaous, and of the road
that he was come. And while he questioned he took muster of him with his
eyes, and when he had done speaking he cried-

"Surely thou art Rustem, for thou hast the arms and breast of a
Pehliva."

But Rustem replied, "Not so, I am but a slave who is not held worthy to
serve even in his train; for he is a Pehliva great and strong, whose
like the earth hath not seen." Then he handed unto the King the writing
of his master. But when the King had read it he was wild with anger, and
he said to Rustem-

"Surely he that hath sent thee is mad that he addresseth such words unto
me. For if he be master in Iran, I am lord of Mazinderan, and never
shall he call me his vassal. And verily it was his own overweening that
let him fall between my hands, yet hath he learned no lesson from his
disasters, but deemeth he can crush me with haughty words. Go, say unto
him that the King of Mazinderan will meet him in battle, and verily his
pride shall learn to know humility."

And when the King had thus spoken he dismissed Rustem from his presence,
but he would have had him bear forth rich gifts. But Rustem would not
take them, for he too was angered, and he spurred him unto Kai Kaous
with a heart hungry for vengeance.

And Kai Kaous made ready his army, and the King of Mazinderan did
likewise. And they marched forth unto the meeting-place, and the earth
groaned under the feet of the war-elephants. And for seven days did the
battle rage fast and furious, and all the earth was darkened with the
black dust; and the fire of swords and maces flashed through the
blackness like to lightning from a thundercloud. And the screams of the
Deevs, and the shouts of the warriors, and the clanging of the trumpets,
and the beating of drums, and the neighing of horses, and the groans of
the dying made the earth hideous with noise. And the blood of the brave
turned the plain into a lake, and it was a combat such as none hath seen
the like. But victory leaned to neither side. Then on the eighth day Kai
Kaous took from his head the crown of the Kaianides and bowed him in the
dust before Ormuzd. And he prayed and said-

"O Lord of earth, incline thine ear unto my voice, and grant that I may
overcome these Deevs who rest not their faith in Thee. And I pray Thee
do this not for my sake, who am unworthy of Thy benefits, but for the
sake of Iran, Thy kingdom."

Then he put the crown once more upon his head, and went out again before
the army.

And all that day the hosts fought like lions, and pity and mercy were
vanished from the world, and heaven itself seemed to rain maces. But
Ormuzd had heard the prayer of His servant, and when evening was come
the army of Mazinderan was faded like a flower. Then Rustem, perceiving
the King of Mazinderan, challenged him to single combat. And the King
consented, and Rustem overcame him, and raised his lance to strike him,
saying-

"Perish, O evil Deev! for thy name is struck out of the lists of those
who carry high their heads."

But when he was about to strike him, the King put forth his arts of
magic, and he was changed into a rock within sight of all the army. And
Rustem was confounded thereat, and he knew not what he should do. But
Kai Kaous commanded that the rock should be brought before his throne.
So those among the army who were strong of limb meshed it with cords and
tried to raise it from the earth. But the rock resisted all their
efforts and none could move it a jot. Then Rustem, the elephant-limbed,
came forward to test his power, and he grasped the rock in his mighty
fist, and he bore it in his hands across the hills, even unto the spot
that Kai Kaous had named, and all the army shouted with amazement when
they saw it.

Now when Rustem had laid down the stone at the feet of the Shah, he
spake and said unto it-

"Issue forth, I command thee, O King of Mazinderan, or I will break thee
into atoms with my mace."

When the King heard this threat he was afraid, and came out of the
stone, and stood before Rustem in all his vileness. And Rustem took his
hand and smiled and led him before Kai Kaous, and said-

"I bring thee this piece of rock, whom fear of my blows hath brought
into subjection."

Then Kai Kaous reproached the King with all the evil he had done him,
and when he had spoken he bade that the head of this wicked man should
be severed from its trunk. And it was done as Kai Kaous commanded. Then
Kai Kaous gave thanks unto God, and distributed rich gifts unto his
army, to each man according to his deserts. And he prepared a feast, and
bade them rejoice and make merry with wine. And at last he called before
him Rustem, his Pehliva, and gave to him thanks, and said that but for
his aid he would not have sat again upon his throne. But Rustem said-

"Not so, O King, thy thanks are due unto Aulad, for he it was who led me
aright, and instructed me how I could vanquish the Deevs. Grant,
therefore, now that I may fulfil my promise unto him, and bestow on him
the crown of Mazinderan."

When Kai Kaous heard these words he did as Rustem desired, and Aulad
received the crown and the land, and there was peace yet again in Iran.
And the land rejoiced thereat, and Kai Kaous opened the doors of his
treasures, and all was well within his borders. Then Rustem came before
the Shah and prayed that he might be permitted to return unto his
father. And Kai Kaous listened to the just desires of his Pehliva, and
he sent him forth laden with rich gifts, and he could not cease from
pouring treasure before him. And he blessed him, and said-

"Mayst thou live as long as the sun and moon, and may thy heart continue
steadfast, mayst thou ever be the joy of Iran!"

Then when Rustem was departed, Kai Kaous gave himself up unto delights
and to wine, but he governed his land right gloriously. He struck the
neck of care with the sword of justice, he caused the earth to be clad
with verdure, and God granted unto him His countenance, and the hand of
Ahriman could do no hurt.

Thus endeth the history of the march into Mazinderan.
