Feridoun
========

Five hundred years did Feridoun rule the world, and might and virtue
increased in the land, and all his days he did that which was good. And
he roamed throughout the kingdom to seek out that which was open and
that which was hid, and wrong was righted at his hands. With kindness
did he curb the sway of evil. He ordered the world like to a paradise,
he planted the cypress and the rose where the wild herb had sprouted.

Now after many years were passed there were born to him three sons,
whose mother was of the house of Jemshid. And the sons were fair of
mien, tall and strong, yet their names were not known to men, for
Feridoun had not tested their hearts. But when he beheld that they were
come to years of strength he called them about his throne and bade them
search out the King of Yemen, who had three daughters, fair as the moon,
that they should woo them unto themselves. And the sons of Feridoun did
according to the command of their father. They set forth unto Yemen, and
there went with them a host countless as the stars. And when they were
come to Yemen, the King came forth to greet them, and his train was like
to the plumage of a pheasant. Then the sons of Feridoun gained the hands
of the daughters of Serv, King of Yemen, and departed with them to their
own land. And Serv gave to his new sons much treasure laid upon the
backs of camels, and umbrellas too did he give unto them in sign of
kingship.

Now it came about that when Feridoun learned that his sons were
returning, he went forth to meet them and prove their hearts. So he took
upon him the form of a dragon that foamed at the mouth with fury, and
from whose jaws sprang mighty flames. And when his sons were come near
unto the mountain pass, he came upon them suddenly, like to a whirlwind,
and raised a cloud of dust about the place with his writhings, and his
roaring filled the air with noise. Then he threw himself upon the eldest
born, and the prince laid down his spear and said, "A wise and prudent
man striveth not with dragons." And he turned his back and fled before
the monster, and left him to fall upon his brothers. Then the dragon
sprang upon the second, and he said, "An it be that I must fight, what
matter if it be a furious lion or a knight full of valour?" So he took
his bow and stretched it. But the youngest came towards him, and seeing
the dragon, said, "Thou reptile, flee from our presence, and strut not
in the path of lions. For if thou hast heard the name of Feridoun,
beware how thou doest thus, for we are his sons, armed with spears and
ready for the fight. Quit therefore, I counsel thee, thine evil path,
lest I plant upon thy head the crown of enmity."

Then the glorious Feridoun, when he had thus made trial of their hearts,
vanished from their sight. But presently he came again with the face of
their father, and many warriors, elephants, and cymbals were in his
train. And Feridoun bore in his hand the cow-headed mace, and the
Kawanee, the apron of Kawah, the kingly standard, was waved above his
head. Now when the sons saw their father, they alighted from their
steeds and ran to greet him, and kissed the ground before his feet. And
the cymbals were clashed, and the trumpets brayed, and sounds of
rejoicing were heard around. Then Feridoun raised his sons and kissed
their foreheads, and gave unto them honour according to their due. And
when they were come to the royal house he prayed to God that He would
bless his offspring, and calling them about him, he seated them upon
thrones of splendour. Then he opened his mouth and said unto them-

"O my sons, listen unto the words that I shall speak. The raging dragon
whose breath was danger was but your father, who sought to test your
hearts, and having learned them gave way with joy. But now will I give
to you names such as are fitting unto men. The first-born shall be
called Silim (may thy desires be accomplished in the world!) for thou
soughtest to save thyself from the clutches of the dragon, nor didst
thou hesitate in the hour of flight. A man who fleeth neither before an
elephant nor a lion, call him rather foolhardy than brave. And the
second, who from the beginning showed his courage, which was ardent as a
flame, I will call him Tur, the courageous, whom even a mad elephant
cannot daunt. But the youngest is a man prudent and brave, who knoweth
both how to haste and how to tarry; he chose the midway between the
flame and the ground, as it beseemeth a man of counsel, and he hath
proven himself brave, prudent, and bold. Irij shall he be called, that
the gate of power may be his goal, for first did he show gentleness, but
his bravery sprang forth at the hour of danger."

When Feridoun had thus opened his lips he called for the book wherein
are written the stars, and he searched for the planets of his sons. And
he found that Jupiter reigned in the sign of the Archer in the house of
Silim, and the sun in the Lion in that of Tur, but in the house of Irij
there reigned the moon in the Scorpion. And when he saw this he was
sorrowful, for he knew that for Irij were grief and bale held in store.
Then having read the secrets of Fate, Feridoun parted the world and gave
the three parts unto his sons in suzerainty. Roum and Khaver, which are
the lands of the setting sun, did he give unto Silim. Turan and
Turkestan did he give unto Tur, and made him master of the Turks and of
China, but unto Irij he gave Iran, with the throne of might and the
crown of supremacy.

For many years had the sons of Feridoun sat upon their golden thrones in
happiness and peace, but evil was hidden in the bosom of Fate. For
Feridoun had grown old, and his strength inclined to the grave. And as
his life waned, the evil passions of his sons waxed stronger. The heart
of Silim was changed, and his desires turned towards evil; his soul also
was steeped in greed. And he pondered in his spirit the parting of the
lands, and he revolted thereat in his thoughts, because that the
youngest bore the crown of supremacy. Then he bade a messenger mount him
upon a dromedary swift of foot, and bear this saying unto Tur-

"O King of Turan, thy brother greeteth thee, and may thy days be long in
the land. Tell unto me, I pray thee, for thou hast might and wisdom,
should we remain thus ever satisfied, for surely unto us, not unto Irij,
pertaineth the throne of Iran, but now is our brother set above our
heads, and should we not strive against the injustice of our father? "

Now. when Tur had listened to these words, his head was filled with
wind, and he spake unto the messenger and said-

"Say unto your master, O my brother, full of courage, since our father
deceived us when we were young and void of guile, with his own hands
hath he planted a tree whence must issue fruit of blood and leaves that
are poison. Let us therefore meet and take counsel together how we may
rid us of our evil fate."

When Silim heard this he set forth from Roum, and Tur also quitted
China, and they met to counsel together how they should act. Then they
sent a messenger unto Feridoun the glorious, and they said-

"O King, aged and great, fearest thou not to go home unto thy God? for
evil hast thou done, and injustice dost thou leave behind thee. Thy
realm hast thou allotted with iniquity, and thine eldest born hast thou
treated with disfavour. But we thy sons entreat thee that ere it be too
late thou listen to our voice. Command thou Irij to step down from the
throne of Iran, and hide him in some corner of the earth, that he be
weak and forgotten like ourselves. Yet if thou doest not our bidding, we
will bring forth riders from Turkestan and Khaver filled with vengeance,
and will utterly destroy Irij and the land of Iran."

When Feridoun had listened to these hard words he was angered, and
straightway said-

"Speak unto these men, senseless and impure, these sons of Ahriman,
perverse of heart, and say unto them, Feridoun rejoiceth that ye have
laid bare before him your hearts, for now he knoweth what manner of men
ye are. And he answereth unto you that he hath parted his realm with
equity. Many counsellors did he seek, and night and day did they ponder
it, and gave unto each that which seemed best in their sight. And he now
speaketh unto you a word that he doth bid you treasure in your hearts,
As ye sow, so also shall ye reap, for there is for us another, an
eternal home. And this is the rede sent unto you by an aged man, that he
who betrayeth his brother for greed is not worthy to be sprung from a
noble race. So pray unto God that He turn your hearts from evil."

When the messenger had heard these words he departed. Then Feridoun
called Irij before him and warned him against the craft of his brethren,
and bade him prepare an army and go forth to meet them. But Irij, when
he had heard of the evil thoughts of his brothers, was moved, and said-

"Not so, O my father, suffer that I go forth alone and speak unto my
brethren, that I may still the anger that they feel against me. And I
will entreat them that they put not their trust in the glory of this
world, and will recall unto them the name of Jemshid, and how that his
end was evil because that he was uplifted in his heart."

Then Feridoun answered and said, "Go forth, my son, if such be thy
desire. The wish of thy brethren is even unto war, but thou seekest the
paths of peace. Yet I pray thee take with thee worthy knights, and
return unto me with speed, for my life is rooted in thy happiness."

And he gave him a letter signed with his royal seal that he should bear
it unto the kings of Roum and China. And Feridoun wrote how that he was
old, and desired neither gold nor treasures, save only that his sons
should be united. And he commended unto them his youngest born, who was
descended from his throne and come forth to meet them with peace in his
heart.

Now when Irij was come to the spot where his brethren were encamped, the
army saw him and was filled with wonder at his beauty and at his kingly
form, and they murmured among themselves, saying, "Surely this one alone
is worthy to bear the sceptre." But when Silim and Tur heard this murmur
their anger was deepened, and they retreated into their tents, and all
night long did they hold counsel how they might do hurt unto their
brother.

Now when the curtain that hid the sun was lifted, the brethren went
forth unto the tents of Irij. And Irij would have greeted them, but they
suffered him not, but straightway began to question him, and heap
reproaches upon his head. And Tur said-

"Why hast thou uplifted thyself above us, and is it meet that thy elders
bow down before thee?"

When Irij heard their words, he answered, "O Kings greedy of power, I
say unto you, if ye desire happiness, strive after peace. I covet
neither the royal crown nor the hosts of Iran; power that endeth in
discord is an honour that leadeth to tears. And I will step down from
the throne of Iran if it shall foster peace between us, for I crave not
the possession of the world if ye are afflicted by the sight. For I am
humble of heart, and my faith bids me be kind."

Now Tur heard these words, but they softened not his spirit, for he knew
only that which is evil, and wist not that Irij spoke truly. And he took
up the chair whereon he sat and threw it at his brother in his anger.
Then Irij called for mercy at his hands, saying-

"O King, hast thou no fear of God, no pity for thy father? I pray thee
destroy me not, lest God ask vengeance for my blood. Let it not be
spoken that thou who hast life takest that gift from others. Do not this
evil. Crush not even the tiny ant that beareth a grain of corn, for she
hath life, and sweet life is a boon. I will vanish from thy sight, I
will live in solitude and secrecy, so thou grant that I may yet behold
the sun."

But these words angered Tur only the more, and he drew from his boot a
dagger that was poisoned and sharp, and he thrust it into the breast of
Irij, the kingly cedar. And the young lord of the world paled and was
dead. Then Tur cut the head from the trunk, and filled it with musk and
ambergris, and sent it unto the old man his father, who had parted the
world, saying-

"Behold the head of thy darling, give unto him now the crown and the
throne."

And when they had done this evil deed the brethren furled their tents,
and turned them back again unto the lands of Roum and Cathay.

Now Feridoun held his eyes fastened upon the road whither Irij was gone,
and his heart yearned after him. And when he heard that the time of his
return was come, he bade a host go forth to meet him, and he himself
went in the wake. Now when they were gone but a little way they beheld a
mighty cloud of dust upon the sky. And the cloud neared, and there came
thence a dromedary whereon was seated a knight clad in the garb of woe.
And he bare in his arms a casket of gold, and in the casket were rich
stuffs of silk, and in the stuffs was wrapped the head of Irij. And when
Feridoun beheld the face of the messenger his heart was smote with fear,
but when he saw the head of his son he fell from his horse with sorrow.
Then a cry of wailing rent the air, and the army shouted for grief, and
the flags were torn, and the drums broken, and the elephants and cymbals
hung with the colours of mourning, because that Irij was gone from the
world. And Feridoun returned on foot unto the city, and all the nobles
went with him, and they retraced their steps in the dust. Now when they
were come to the garden of Irij, Feridoun faltered in his sorrow, and he
pressed the head of the young King, his son, unto his breast. And he
cast black earth upon his throne, and tore his hair, and shed tears, and
his cries mounted even unto the seventh sphere. And he spake in his
grief and said-

"O Master of the world, that metest out justice, look down, I pray thee,
upon this innocent whom his brethren have foully murdered! Sear their
hearts that joy cannot enter, and grant unto me my prayer. Suffer that I
may live until a hero, a warrior mighty to avenge, be sprung from the
seed of Irij. Then when I shall have beheld his face I will go hence as
it beseemeth me and the earth shall cover my body."

Thus wept Feridoun in the bitterness of his soul, neither would he take
comfort day and night, nor quit the garden of his son. And the earth was
his couch and the dust his bed, and he watered the ground with his
tears. And he rested in this spot till that the grass was grown above
his bosom, and his eyes were blinded with weeping. Yet his tongue did
not cease from plaining and his heart from sorrow. And he cried
continually-

"O Irij, O my son, my son, never prince died a death like thine! Thy
head was severed by Ahriman, thy body torn by lions."

Thus mourned Feridoun, and the voice of lamentation was abroad.

Then it came about that after many years had passed Feridoun bethought
him of the daughter of Irij, and how that men said she was fair. And he
sought for her in the house of the women; and when he learned that she
was fair indeed, he desired that a husband be found for her, and he
wedded her unto Pescheng, who was a hero of the race of Jemshid. And
there was born unto them a son fair and strong, worthy the throne. And
when he was yet but a tender babe they brought him to Feridoun and
cried-

"O Lord of earth, let thy soul rejoice, behold this Irij!"

Then the lips of Feridoun were wreathed with smiles, and he took up the
infant in his arms and cried unto God, saying-

"O God, grant that my sight be restored unto me, that I may behold the
face of this babe."

And as he prayed his eyes were opened, and his sight rested upon his
son. Then Feridoun gave thanks unto God. And he called down blessings
upon the child, and prayed that the day might be blessed also, and the
heart of his enemies be torn with anguish. And he named him Minuchihr,
saying, "A branch worthy of a noble stock hath borne fruit." And the
child was reared in the house of Feridoun, and he suffered not that ill
came near unto him, and though the years passed above his head the stars
brought him no evil. And when he was of a ripe age Feridoun gave to
Minuchihr a throne of gold, and a mace, and a crown of jewels, and the
key to all his treasures. Then he commanded his nobles that they should
do him reverence and salute him king. And there were gathered about the
throne Karun, the son of Kawah, and Serv, King of Yemen, and Guerschasp
the victorious, and many other mighty princes more than tongue can name.
But the young Shah outshone them in strength and beauty, and joy was
once more in the land.

But tidings of the splendour that surrounded Feridoun pierced even unto
the lands of Roum and China, and the kings thereof were troubled and
downcast in their hearts. Then they conferred how they should regain the
favour of the Shah, for they feared Minuchihr when he should be come
unto years of might. So they sent a messenger unto Feridoun bearing rich
gifts, and bade him speak unto their father and say-

"O Shah, live for ever I bear a message from the humblest of thy slaves,
who are bowed unto the earth with contrition, wherefore they have not
ventured into thy presence. And they pray that thou pardon their evil
deed, for their hearts are good, and they did it not of themselves, but
because it was written that they should do this wrong, and that which is
written in the stars surely it is accomplished. And therefore, O King,
their eyes are filled with tears, and they pray thee incline unto them
thine ear. And as a sign of thy grace send unto them Minuchihr thy son,
for their hearts yearn to look upon his face and do him homage."

Now when Feridoun had listened to the words of his sons, he knitted his
brows in anger, for he knew that they sought only to beguile him. And he
said unto the messenger-

"Go, say unto your masters that their false-hearted words shall avail
them nothing. And ask them if they be not shamed to utter white words
with tongues of blackness. I have heard their message, hear now the
answer that I send. Ye say unto me that ye desire the love of Minuchihr,
and I ask of you, What did ye for Irij? And now that ye are delivered of
him ye seek the blood of his son. Verily I say unto you, never shall ye
look upon his face save when he leadeth a mighty army. Then shall be
watered with blood the leaves and fruits of the tree sprung from the
vengeance that is due. For unto this day hath vengeance slumbered, since
it became me not to stretch forth mine hand in battle upon my sons; but
now is there sprung a branch from the tree which the enemy uprooted, and
he shall come as a raging lion, girt with the vengeance of his sire. And
I say unto you, take back the treasures ye have sent me, for think ye
that for coloured toys I will abandon my vengeance, and efface for
baubles the blood that ye have spilled, or sell for gold the head of
mine offspring? And say yet again that while the father of Irij lives he
will not abandon his intent. And now that thou hast listened unto my
message, lay it up in thy heart and make haste from hence."

When the messenger had heard these words he departed with speed. And
when he was come unto Silim and Tur he told them thereof, and how he had
seen Minuchihr sitting upon a throne of gold, and how for strength he
was like unto Tahumers, who had bound the Deevs. And he told how heroes
bearing names that filled the world with wonder stood round about him,
Kawah the smith, and Karun his son, and Serv, the King of Yemen, and
next in might unto the Shah was Saum, the son of Neriman, the
unvanquished in fight, and Guerschasp the victorious, his treasurer.
Then he spake of the treasures that filled the house of Feridoun, and of
the army great in number, so that the men of Roum and China could not
stand against them. And he told how their hearts were filled with hatred
of the Kings because of Irij.

The Kings, when they heard this and the message of their father,
trembled for fear. And Tur said unto Silim-

"Henceforth we must forego pleasure, for it behoveth us to hasten, and
not tarry till the teeth of this young lion be sharpened, and he be
waxed tall and strong."

Then they made ready their armies, and the number of their men was past
the counting. Helmet was joined to helmet, and spear to spear, and
jewels, baggage, and elephants without number went with them, and you
would have said it was a host that none could understand. And they
marched from Turan into Iran, and the two Kings rode before them, their
hearts filled with hate. But the star of these evil ones was sinking.
For Feridoun, when he learned that an army had crossed the Jihun, called
unto him Minuchihr his son, and bade him place himself at the head of
the warriors. And the host of the Shah was mighty to behold, great and
strong, and it covered the land like unto a cloud of locusts. And they
marched from Temmische unto the desert, and Minuchihr commanded them
with might. And on his right rode Karun the Avenger, and on his left
Saum, the son of Neriman, and above their heads waved the flag of Kawah,
and their armour glistened in the sun. Like as a lion breaketh forth
from the jungle to seize upon his prey, so did this army rush forth to
avenge the death of Irij. And the head of Minuchihr rose above the rest
like to the moon or the sun when it shineth above the mountains. And he
exhorted them in words of fire that they rest not, neither weary, until
they should have broken the power of these sons of Ahriman.

Now Tur and Silim, when they saw that the Iranians were come out against
them, set in order their army. And when the day had torn asunder the
folds of night, the two armies met in battle, and the fight waged strong
until the setting of the sun. And the earth was a sea of blood, and the
feet of the elephants were like to pillars of coral. And when the sun
was sunk to his rest, Tur and Silim consulted how they might seize upon
Minuchihr by fraud, for they saw that his arm was strong and his courage
undaunted. So Tur set forth at the head of a small band to surprise him
in his tents. But Minuchihr was aware of his evil plans, and sprang upon
him. And when Tur would have fled Minuchihr followed after him and
struck a lance into his back. And when he had killed him he cut his head
from his trunk, and the body did he give unto the wild beasts, but the
head he sent to Feridoun. And he wrote to him and sent him greeting, and
told him all that was come about, and how he should neither rest nor
tarry until the death of Irij be avenged.

Now Silim, when he learned the fate of his brother, was sore afraid, and
cast about him for an ally. And there came unto him Kakoui, of the seed
of Zohak. But Minuchihr wrestled with him for a morning's space and
overcame him also, though the Deev was strong and powerful in fight.
Then Silim was cast down yet more, and he sought to hide him by the
sea-shore. But Minuchihr cut off his path and overtook him, and with his
own hand he slew him, and cut his head from his trunk. And he raised the
head upon his lance. And when the army of Silim saw this they fled into
the hills, and vanished like cattle whom the snow hath driven from their
pasture. Then they took counsel and chose out a man from among their
midst, one that was prudent and gentle of speech. And they bade him go
before the Shah and say-

"Have mercy upon us, O Shah, for neither hate nor vengeance drove us
forth against thee, but only this, that we obeyed the wills of our
lords. But we ourselves are peaceful men, tillers of the earth and
keepers of cattle, and we pray thee that thou let us return in safety
whence we are come. And we acknowledge thee our Shah, and we pray thee
make thy servants acquainted with thy desires."

When Minuchihr had heard these words he spake and said-

"My desire is not after these men, neither is my longing after blood but
mercy. Let every man lay down his arms and go his ways, and let peace be
in the land, and joy wait upon your feet."

When the men heard this they praised the Shah, and called down blessings
upon his head. And they came before him, every man bearing his armour
and the weapons of battle. And they laid them at his feet, and of
weapons there was reared a mighty mountain, and the blue steel glistened
in the sun. Then Minuchihr dismissed them graciously. And when the army
was dispersed he sent a messenger unto Feridoun bearing the head of
Silim and a writing. And when he had ordered all things he set out at
the head of his warriors unto the city of Feridoun. And his grandsire
came forth to meet him, and there came with him many elephants swathed
in gold, and warriors arrayed in rich attire, and a large multitude clad
in garments of bright hue. And flags waved above them, and trumpets
brayed, and cymbals clashed, and sounds of rejoicing filled the air. But
when Minuchihr saw that his grandsire came towards him, he got from his
horse and ran to meet him, and fell at his feet and craved his blessing.
And Feridoun blessed Minuchihr and raised him from the dust. And he bade
him sit again upon his horse and took his hand, and they entered the
city in triumph. And when they were come to the King's house, Feridoun
seated Minuchihr upon a throne of gold. Then he called unto him Saum,
the son of Neriman, and said-

"I pray thee bring up this youth and nourish him for the kingdom, and
aid him with thy might and mind."

And he took the hand of Minuchihr and put it into that of Saum, and
said-

"Thanks be unto God the merciful, who hath listened unto my voice, and
granted the desires of His servant. For now shall I go hence, and the
world will I cumber no more."

Then when he had given gifts unto his servants he withdrew into
solitude, and gazed without cease upon the heads of his sons, neither
refrained he from bewailing their evil fate, and the sorrow they had
brought upon him. And daily he grew fainter, and at last the light of
his life expired, and Feridoun vanished from the earth, but his name
remained behind him. And Minuchihr mourned for his grandsire with
weeping and lamentation, and raised above him a stately tomb. But when
the seven days of mourning were ended, he put upon his head the crown of
the Kaianides, and girt his loins with a red sash of might. And the
nation called him Shah, and he was beloved in the land.
