The Sermon Given By The Prophet (s) On The Last Friday Of Sha'ban On The Reception Of The Month of Ramadhan
===========================================================================================================

*“O People !*

*“Indeed ahead of you is the blessed month of Allah. A month of
blessing, mercy and forgiveness. A month which with Allah is the best of
months. Its days, the best of days, its nights, the best of nights, and
its hours, the best of hours. It is the month which invites you to be
the guests of Allah and invites you to be one of those near to Him. Each
breath you take glorifies him; your sleep is worship, your deeds are
accepted and your supplications are answered.*

*So, ask Allah, your Lord; to give you a sound body and an enlightened
heart so you may be able to fast and recite his book, for only he is
unhappy who is devoid of Allah’s forgiveness during this great month.
Remember the hunger and thirst of the day of Qiyamah (Judgement) with
your hunger and thirst; give alms to the needy and poor, honor your old,
show kindness to the young ones, maintain relations with your blood
relations; guard your tongues, close your eyes to that which is not
permissible for your sight, close your ears to that which is forbidden
to hear, show compassion to the orphans of people so compassion may be
shown to your orphans.*

*Repent to Allah for your sins and raise your hands in dua during these
times, for they are the best of times and Allah looks towards his
creatures with kindness, replying to them during the hours and granting
their needs if he is asked...*

*“O People! Indeed your souls are dependant on your deeds, free it with
Istighfar (repentance) lighten its loads by long prostrations; and know
that Allah swears by his might: That there is no punishment for the one
who prays and prostrates and he shall have no fear of the fire on the
day when man stands before the Lord of the worlds.*

*“O People! One who gives Iftaar to a fasting person during this month
will be like one who has freed someone and his past sins will be
forgiven.*

Some of the people who were there then asked the Prophet (s): “Not all
of us are able to invite those who are fasting?”

*The Prophet (s) replied: “Allah gives this reward even if the Iftaar
(meal) is a drink of water.”*

*“One who has good morals (Akhlaq) during this month will be able to
pass the ‘Siraat’...on the day that feet will slip...*

*“One who covers the faults of others will benefit in that Allah will
curb His anger on the day of Judgement...*

*“As for one who honors an orphan; Allah will honor him on the day of
judgement,*

*“And for the one who spreads his kindness, Allah will spread His mercy
over him on the day of Judgement.*

*“As for the one who cuts the ties of relation; Allah will cut His mercy
from him...*

*“Who so ever performs a recommended prayer in this month Allah will
keep the fire of Hell away from him...*

*“Whoever performs an obligator prayer Allah will reward him with
seventy prayers [worth] in this month.*

*“And who so ever prays a lot during this month will have his load
lightened on the day of measure.*

*“He who recites one verse of the holy Quran will be given the rewards
of reciting the hole Qur’an during other months.*

*“O People! Indeed during this month the doors of heaven are open,
therefore ask Allah not to close them for you; The doors of hell are
closed, so ask Allah to keep them closed for you. During this month
Shaytan (Saten) is imprisoned so ask your Lord not to let him have power
over you.”*
