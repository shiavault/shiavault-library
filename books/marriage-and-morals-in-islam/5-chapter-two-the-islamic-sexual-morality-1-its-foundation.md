Chapter Two: The Islamic Sexual Morality (1) Its Foundation
===========================================================

A. Defining the Islamic View
----------------------------

The Islamic sexual morality is fundamentally different from that of the
Christian Church. This is because of the all-encompassing nature of the
Islamic shari'ah. Bertrand Russell says, "Great religious leaders, with
the exception of Muhammad and Confucius, if he can be called religious
have in general been very indifferent to social and political
considerations, and have sought rather to perfect the soul by
meditation, discipline and self-denial."[^1]

Yes, Islam has surely not been indifferent to social problems.

The Islamic sexual morality is also fundamentally different from the new
sexual morality in a sense that it does not accept the concept of free
sex. Islam aims at teaching its followers not to suppress their sexual
urges, rather to fulfil them but in a responsible way.

Islam recognizes the sexual needs of human beings and believes that the
natural instincts should be nurtured, not suppressed. Islam says that
the biological parts of our body have a purpose; they have not been
created uselessly. No text in Islam can be found to equate sex with
inherent evil or sin; whatever has been taught by the Qur'an, Prophet
Muhammad and his Ahlu'l-bayt points in the opposite direction.

What the Qur'an and the authentic sunnah and I emphasize on authentic
have said about sex and marriage will now be discussed under the
following headings: Islam has very highly recommended marriage as a good
deed and not as a lesser of two evils; Islam has very strongly opposed
celibacy and monasticism, and Islam believes that marriage is not a
hindrance in spiritual wayfaring, on the contrary it helps the wayfarer.

### 1. Marriage is Highly Recommended

It is important to realize that in Islamic texts the idea of marriage is
not restricted to a platonic relationship between husband and wife, nor
is it confined to sex for the purpose of procreation . The legal term
for marriage is *"nikah"* which literally means sexual intercourse.

Marriage is a highly recommended deed. Allah says,

***"Marry the spouseless among you...if they are poor, God will enrich
them of His bounty."*** ***(Qur'an 24:32)***

The first word of this verse begins with *"ankihu"* (Marry!) which is an
imperative form of the word *nikah.* According to the principles of
Islamic jurisprudence, any communication in imperative form from God can
have two levels of meaning: either it is an obligatory command or a very
high recommendation.

And therefore we see that in Islam celibacy is not considered as a
virtue. Based on this verse we find the Prophet saying that, "Whoever
refrains from marriage because of fear of poverty, he has indeed thought
badly of God."[^2] In another verse Allah says:

***"... Then marry such women as seem good to you two, three or four.
But if you fear that you will not do justice between your wives, then
marry only one..."*** ***(4:3)***

Sex has been openly recommended in the Qur'an,

***"When they [i.e., the wives] have cleansed themselves [after
menstruation], you go into them as Allah has commanded."***
***(2:222)***

The phrase 'commanded you' does not refer to any legislative command;
that is, it does not mean that as soon as a person's wife becomes clean
from her period, he should immediately have sex with her. It is a
creative command and refers to the sexual urge which Allah has placed in
our nature. And when the sexual urge is counted as a creative command of
God, then who can associate it in any way with sin and evil?!

Marriage and sex are among the signs of God's power and blessings. The
Qur'an says,

***"And among His signs is that He has created for you spouses from
among yourselves so that you may live in*** ***tranquillity with them;
and He has created love and mercy between you. Verily, in that are signs
for those who reflect."*** ***(30:21)***

From these few verses of the Qur'an, one can easily understand that
according to Islam: (a) marriage is a sign of God's power and blessings;
(b) marriage is a highly recommended act of virtue which should not be
avoided because of poverty; (c) sexual urge is a creative command of God
placed in human nature. After equating sex with Allah's creative
command, there can be no room for equating it with guilt, sin or evil.

\* \* \*

The Prophet and the Imams of Ahlu'l Bayt also encouraged their followers
to marry and to fulfill their sexual urges in lawful ways as can be seen
from the following: The Prophet said, "No house has been built in Islam
more beloved in the sight of Allah than through marriage."[^3]

The Prophet said, "O you young men! I recommend marriage to you."[^4]
Imam 'Ali said, "Marry, because marriage is the tradition of the
Prophet.

The Prophet said, 'Whosoever likes to follow my tradition, then he
should know that marriage is from my tradition.'"[^5] Imam Riza said,
"Three things are from the traditions of the messengers of God: using
perfume, removing the [excessive] hair and frequently visiting one's
wife."[^6] Ishaq bin 'Ammar quotes Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq as follows:
"Loving women is among the traditions of the prophets." [^7]

The Prophet said, "Prayer has been made the apple of my eyes, and my
pleasure is in women." [^8] See with what ease the Prophet moves from
prayers to the pleasure of women! The Prophet said, "No Muslim man has
gained a benefit after [the religion of] Islam better than a Muslim wife
who is a cause of his pleasure whenever he looks towards her..."[^9]

Imam Muhammad al-Baqir quotes the Prophet as follows: "Allah says that,
'Whenever I intend to gather the good of this world and the hereafter
for a Muslim, I give him a heart which is humble [to Me], a tongue which
praises [Me], a body which can bear [worldly] affliction and a believing
wife who is a cause of his pleasure whenever he looks towards her and
who protects herself and his property when he is absent."[^10] See with
what ease Allah has combined His praise with the pleasure a man derives
from a faithful wife!

Jamil bin Darraj quotes Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq saying, "Mankind has not
enjoyed [anything] in this world and the hereafter more than the desire
for women. Allah says, **'*****The love of desire of women has been made
to seem fair to people.'*****[3:14]** The people of the Paradise do not
enjoy anything from it more desirable than sex, neither food nor
drink."[^11]

### 2. Celibacy & Monasticism is Forbidden

The Islamic point of view about the worldly good things is not negative,
rather it says that we should appreciate them as the blessings of God.
And Islam is, therefore, totally opposed to monasticism and celibacy.
'Uthman bin Maz'un was a close companion of the Prophet. One day his
wife came to the Prophet and complained, "O the Messenger of God!
'Uthman fasts during the day and stands for prayers during the night."

In other words, she meant to say that her husband was abstaining from
sexual relations during the night as well as the day. The Prophet was so
much angered with this that he did not even wait to put on his slippers.

He came out with the slippers in his hands and went to 'Uthman's house.
The Prophet found him praying. When 'Uthman finished his prayers and
turned towards the Prophet, the latter said, "O 'Uthman! Allah did not
send me for monasticism, rather He sent me with a simple and straight
*[shari'ah]*.

I fast, pray and also have intimate relations with my wife. So whosoever
likes my tradition, then he should follow it; and marriage is one of my
traditions.[^12] Since 'Uthman was already married, the word "marriage"
in this hadith can only be applied to sexual relations.

In another incident, three women came to the Prophet and complained that
their husbands were abstaining from meat, perfume and intimate relations
with their wives. The Prophet quickly came to the mosque, went on the
pulpit and said, "What has happened to some of my companions that they
do not eat meat, they do not use perfume and they do not go to their
women?! Whereas I eat meat, use perfume and go to my wives. Therefore
whosoever dislikes my tradition, then he is not from me.[^13]

Ibn Abu 'Umayr quotes that Sikkin an-Nakha'i had devoted himself to
prayers and abstinence from women and delicious food. Then he wrote a
letter to Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq seeking clarification about his actions.
The Imam wrote, "As for what you have said about abstaining from women,
you surely know how many women the Prophet had! As for food, the Prophet
used to eat meat and honey."[^14] The Imam is obviously condemning the
holier-than-thou attitude of his companion.

Imam 'Ali narrates that some companions of the Prophet had vowed to
abstain from sexual relations with their wives, from eating during the
day and from sleeping during the night. Umm Salamah, the Prophet' s
wife, informed him about this group. The Prophet went out to his
companions and said, "Do you abstain from women whereas I go to the
women?! I eat during the day and sleep during the night! Whosoever
dislikes my tradition, then he is not from me." After this speech, Allah
revealed the following verse:

***O you who believe! Do not forbid [for yourselves] the good things
which Allah has permitted you; and do not exceed [the law] Allah does
not like those who exceed [the law]. Therefore eat of the lawful and
good things that Allah has provided you, and fear Allah in whom you
believe.*** ***(5:87-8)***

Read this verse carefully and see that firstly, it counts sex, food and
sleep among "the lawful and good things which Allah has permitted you;"
and secondly celibacy and abstinence is considered as "exceeding the law
of God."

After this verse was revealed, those companions came to the Prophet and
said, "O Messenger of God! We have taken oath to abstain from those
things." That is, how can we now break our oath of abstinence? Then
Allah revealed the following verse:

***"Allah will not call you*** ***[to account] for vain oaths..."***
***(5:84)***

Again, note that an oath of celibacy or abstinence from the good and
lawful things is considered by Islam as 'vain oaths!'[^15]

The discouraging of celibacy is not confined to men, even women have
been discouraged from remaining single. Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq said, "The
Prophet has forbidden the women to become ascetic and to prevent
themselves from husbands."[^16]

'Abdus Samad bin Bashir quotes that a woman came to Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq
and said, "May God bless you; I am an ascetic woman."

The Imam: "What does asceticism mean to you?"

The woman: "It means that I will never marry."

The Imam: "Why?"

The woman: "By practicing asceticism, I want to acquire favor (of God)."

The Imam: "Go away! If asceticism was a means of acquiring favor (of
God), then Fatimah would have been more entitled to it than you because
none can gain more favor [in the eyes of Allah] than her."[^17]

A similar incident is also narrated in relation to Imam Riza.

The Prophet said, "The most low [in status] among your dead are the
singles."[^18]

Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq says that a person came to my father. My father
asked him, "Do you have a wife?" He said, "No. "My father said, "I would
not prefer to have the world with all its riches while I sleep at night
without a wife."[^19]

### 3. Marriage Helps in Spirituality

In Islam, contrary to Christianity, marriage and sex are not
antipathetic to the love for and worship of God. Instead of an obstacle,
marriage is regarded as an asset in acquiring spiritual perfection.

The Prophet said, "One who marries has already guarded half of his
religion, therefore he should fear Allah for the other half."[^20] A
person who can fulfill his sexual urges lawfully is less distracted in
the spiritual journey. Love for women and faith are inter-related.

In one hadith, 'Umar bin Zayd quotes Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq that, "I do
not think that a person's faith can increase positively unless his love
for women has increased."[^21] The same Imam said, "Whenever a person's
love for women increases, his faith increases in quality."[^22] He also
said, "Whosoever's love for us increases, his love for women must also
increase."[^23]

Marriage even elevates the value of prayers. The Prophet said, "Two rak
'ats (cycles) prayed by a married person is better than the night-vigil
and the fast of a single person."[^24] Ibn Fuzzal quotes Imam Ja'far
as-Sadiq saying that, "Two rak'ats prayed by a married person is better
than seventy rak'ats prayed by a single person."[^25]

The Prophet said, "If anyone likes to meet Allah in purity, then he
should meet Him with a wife."[^26]

A woman came to the Prophet's house and her strong perfume soon filled
the house. When the Prophet inquired about the visitor, the woman said
that she had tried everything to attract her husband but in vain; he
does not leave his meditation to pay any attention to her.

The Prophet told her to inform her husband about the reward of sexual
intercourse which he described as follows: "When a man approaches his
wife, he is guarded by two angels and [at that moment in Allah's views]
he is like a warrior fighting for the cause of Allah. When he has
intercourse with her, his sins fell like the leaves of the tree [in fall
season]. When he performs the major ablution, he is cleansed from
sins.[^27]

\* \* \*

These quotations from the Qur'an and the sayings of the Prophet and the
Imams of Ahlu'l-bayt show that the Islamic view on sex and marriage is
in complete harmony with human nature. It can easily be concluded that
in the Islamic sexual morality:

(a) marriage and sex is highly recommended and it is in no way
associated with evil, guilt or sin;

(b) monasticism and celibacy is unacceptable;

(c) marriage is considered a helping factor in attaining spiritual
perfection it prevents the Muslims from getting into sins and also
enhances the value of their acts of worship.

These teachings neutralize the need for a sexual revolution in a Muslim
society. Since there is no sexual suppression, the question of a sexual
revolution does not arise.

B. Defending the Islamic View
-----------------------------

There are many non-Muslim writers, especially of liberal and feminist
ideology, who have attacked the Islamic view of woman's sexuality. Their
criticism is mostly based on some misconceived ideas about the Islamic
sexual morality. Basically there are two problems with these writers:
either they study Islam based on some Western social theories and
models, or they are ill-equipped to study the original Islamic sources.

They rely mostly on the work done on Islam by the Orientalists or the
European travelers of the past centuries. In some cases, books like
*Thousand and One Nights* and *The Perfumed Garden* are used to explain
the Islamic view on women's sexuality! These books, at the most, reflect
the Arab view of female sexuality not the Islamic view. Therefore, these
writings do not even deserve refutation.

However, for our discussion I have selected the work of an Arab feminist
writer, Fatima Mernissi. The reason for commenting on her work is that
she is an Arab writer who had easy excess to Islamic literature and
*hadith*, in particular *Ihyau 'Ulumi 'd-Din* of the famous Sunni
scholar Imam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (d. 1111 C.E.). Moreover, Mernissi's
book has been translated into various European and Asian languages and
is becoming popular as an insider's report!

### 1. Mernissi’s Views

Fatima Mernissi's book, *Beyond the Veil* subtitled as "Male-Female
Dynamics in Modern Muslim Society," is a study of the male-female
relationship in the present Moroccan society. It is important to bear in
mind that the attitude of the Muslims of Morocco does not necessarily
represent Islam.

However, Mernissi has discussed the Islamic sexual morality in a chapter
entitled as "The Muslim Concept of Active Female Sexuality." The main
part of her discussion centres on the comparison between the views of
Freud and Ghazali on female sexuality. Mernissi has summarized her
conclusion as follows:

The irony is that Muslim and European theories come to the same
conclusion: women are destructive to the social order for Imam Ghazali
because they are active, for Freud because they are not.

Then she goes on to describe the negative attitude of the Christian West
and the positive attitude of Islam towards sexuality in general. She
writes:

Different social orders have integrated the tensions between religion
and sexuality in different ways. In the Western Christian experience
sexuality itself is attacked, degraded as animalistic and condemned as
anti-civilization.

The individual is split into two antithetical selves: the spirit and the
flesh, the ego and the id. The triumph of civilization implied the
triumph of soul over flesh, of ego over id, of the controlled over the
uncontrolled, of spirit over sex. Islam took a substantially different
path.

What is attacked and debased is not sexuality but women, as the
embodiment of destruction, the symbol of disorder. The woman is fitna,
the epitome of the uncontrollable, a living representative of the
dangers of sexuality and its rampant disruptive potential...Sexuality
per se is not a danger. On the contrary it has three positive, vital
functions...[^28]

After describing the positive side of Islamic sexual morality, Mernissi
attacks the concept of female sexuality in Islam as she has understood
it from Ghazali's writings:

According to Ghazali, the most precious gift God gave humans is reason.
Its best use is the search for knowledge...But to be able to devote his
energies to knowledge, man has to reduce the tensions within and without
his body, avoid being distracted by external elements, and avoid
indulging in earthly pleasures.

Women are dangerous distraction that must be used for the specific
purpose of providing the Muslim nation with offspring and quenching the
tensions of the sexual instinct. But in no way should women be an object
of emotional investment or the focus of attention; which should be
devoted to Allah alone in the form of knowledge-seeking, meditation, and
prayer.[^29]

The conclusion which this ardent Arab feminist describes as the Islamic
view can be summarized as follows: (a) Women are considered sexually
active in the Islamic view; (b) therefore, women are a danger to the
social order. (c) There should be no emotional investment in women; that
is, a man should have no love for his wife.

(d) Why should there be no love between husband and wife? Mernissi would
answer that love should be exclusively devoted to Allah. Now let us deal
with each of these premises and conclusions gradually and see whether or
not they are based on any reliable Islamic sources.

#### Women are Considered Sexually Active in Islam

The statement that in Islam women are considered sexually active, can
mean two different things: either they are more sexually active than men
or they are as sexually active as men. In the first sense, it would mean
that women have a stronger sex drive; and in the second sense, it would
mean that women are as normal as men in their sexuality. By looking at
the context of Mernissi's writing, I would be justified in saying that
she is using this statement in the first sense, that is, women are more
sexually active than men.

In my study of the Qur'an and authentic *ahadith* on this subject, I
have not come across any statement which says that women are more
sexually active than men. I can say with confidence that as far as Islam
is concerned, there is no difference between the sexuality of men and
women.

There are, however, certain *ahadith* which can be used by Mernissi to
prove that women are more sexually active than men provided she decides
to stick to one part of those *ahadith* and ignore the other part! It is
obvious that such partial use of *hadith* is an unacceptable academic
exercise.

For example, in one such *hadith*, Asbagh bin Nubatah quotes Imam 'Ali
as follows: "Almighty God has created the sexual desire in ten parts;
then He gave nine parts to women and one to men." If the *hadith* had
ended here, Mernissi would be right in her claim, but the *hadith* goes
on: "And if the Almighty God had not given the women equal parts of
shyness, then each man would have nine women related to him." [^30]

In other words, Allah has given the women greater part of sexual desire
but He has also neutralized it by giving equal parts of shyness to them.
Seen as a whole, this and other similar *ahadith* do not support the
claim that in Islam women are more sexually active then men. As for the
question that why did Allah give more sexual desire to women and then
neutralize it with shyness, I shall *inshaAllah* deal with it in the
chapter on sexual technique. So how has Mernissi arrived at her
conclusion?

While contrasting the views of Freud and Ghazali on passive and active
sexuality of women, Fatima Mernissi has studied the view of both writers
on the process of human reproduction. First she quotes Freud as follows:
"The male sex cell is actively mobile and searches out the female and
the latter, the ovum, is immobile and waits passively..."[^31] This
proves to Mernissi that in Freud's view, woman is sexually passive.

Then she contrasts this with Ghazali's view by quoting him as follows,
"The child is not created from man's sperm alone, but from the union of
a sperm from the male with a ovum from the female...and in any case the
ovum of the female is a determinant factor in the process of
coagulation."[^32] This proves to Mernissi that in Ghazali's view, woman
is sexually active.

I doubt whether Ghazali would agree with the conclusion which Mernissi
draws from his last sentence. Moreover, even if Ghazali meant such a
thing, then it cannot be substantiated from the original sources of
Islam, the Qur'an and the *sunnah*.

We have a clear *hadith* which refutes such a connotation to the process
of reproduction. Once the Prophet was asked, "O Muhammad! Why is that in
some cases the child resembles his paternal uncles and has no
resemblance whatsoever to his maternal uncles, and in some cases he
resembles his maternal uncles and has no resemblance whatsoever to his
paternal uncles?"

The Prophet said, "Whosoever's water-drop [i.e., sperm or ovum]
overwhelms that of his or her partner, the child will resemble that
person."[^33] In other words, if the wife's ovum overwhelms the sperm of
her husband, then the child will resemble the mother or the maternal
uncles; and if the husband's sperm overwhelms the ovum of his wife, then
the child will resemble the father or the paternal uncles.

This hadith makes it quite clear that male and female play equal role in
reproduction; sometimes, the male sperm overwhelms the female ovum and
at other times the female ovum overwhelms the male sperm.

Then she quotes Ghazali's statement about the pattern of ejaculation of
sexes as follows, "...The woman's ejaculation is a much slower process
and during that process her sexual desire grows stronger and to withdraw
from her before she reaches her pleasure is harmful to her."[^34]

By this statement, Mernissi wants to prove that in Islam woman is
considered sexually more active than man. When I read this statement for
the first time, I said to myself that this can not be true at all times:
sometimes the male ejaculates first and at other times the female
ejaculates first. And I was surprised that Ghazali would say such a
thing.

So I checked the Arabic statement of Ghazali and noticed that while
translating the above quotation, Mernissi has conveniently left out the
word "*rubbama*" which means "sometimes".[^35] So the correct statement
of Ghazali is that "The woman's ejaculation sometimes is a much slower
process..." With this correction, Mernissi's argument loses its legs.

#### (B) Women are a Danger to the Social Order

The outcome of the above premise of Mernissi is as follows: Since Islam
considers women as sexually more active, therefore, it considers them to
be a danger to the social order.

After quoting Ghazali that, "The virtue of the woman is a man's duty.
And the man should increase or decrease sexual intercourse with the
woman according to her needs so as to secure her virtue," Mernissi
comments, "The Ghazalian theory directly links the security of the
social order to that of the woman's virtue, and thus to the satisfaction
of her sexual needs. Social order is secured when the women limits
herself to her husband and does not create *fitna*, or chaos, by
enticing other men to illicit intercourse."[^36]

Firstly, by looking at Ghazali's statement, I see nothing which would
seem to indicate that in his view women are a danger to the social
order. It simply describes one of the basic rights of conjugal
relationship that the husband should not be a self-centered and selfish
person, rather he should also think about the feelings of his wife.
There is no indication at all that unsatisfied Muslim women in general
would necessarily go out and commit adultery.

Secondly, if unsatisfied women become a danger to the social order just
because there is a possibility that they might commit adultery, then
this possibility is in no way confined to women even unsatisfied men
could commit adultery! If Islam had considered women as a danger to the
social order on this account, then it must also do so with men!

And in stretching this argument to its logical conclusion, one would
have to say that Islam considers men and women a danger to the social
order. You see the absurdity of this line of thought. If all men and
women are a danger to the social order, then whose 'social order' are we
talking about?!

#### (C) There Should be No Emotional Investment in Women

The second part of Mernissi's contention is that in Islam men are not
supposed to be emotionally attached to their wives; love between husband
and wife is not encouraged or tolerated. Apart from what we quoted from
Mernissi on this issue at the beginning of this discussion, she has
talked on this issue, in a passing manner, at other places also.

For instance, after quoting an interview with a Moroccan woman about her
first husband by an arranged marriage (which has nothing to do with
Islam), Mernissi writes, "Does love between man and wife threaten
something vital in the Muslim order?...Heterosexual involvement, real
love between husband and wife, is the danger that must be
overcome."[^37]

In another place, she says, "And it appears to me that the breakdown of
sexual segregation permits the emergence of what the Muslim order
condemns as a deadly enemy of civilization: love between men and women
in general, and between husband and wife in particular."[^38]

Mernissi could not have been more further from the truth than in these
contentions! Instead of going to the original sources of Islam, she has
based her conclusion on the way a certain ethnic group of Muslims behave
in their personal life. Now let us see if what she says is according to
the original sources of Islam or not.

The Qur'an says,

***"And among His signs is that He has created for you spouses from
among yourselves so that you may live in tranquility with them; and He
has created love (muhabbah) and mercy between you. Verily in that are
signs for those who reflect."*** ***(30: 21)***

How can Mernissi say that Islam considers love between husband and wife
a deadly enemy of civilization while the God of Islam counts it as a
sign of His creation and glory? Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq says, "Loving
*(hubb)* women is among the traditions of the prophets."[^39] The same
Imam quotes the Prophet as follows, "The statement of a husband to his
wife that 'I love you' *(inniuhibbuki)* will not leave her heart
ever."[^40]

There are three interesting *ahadith* in which Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq has
described the love for women as a sign and cause of increase in faith.
He says, "I do not think that a person's faith can increase positively
unless his love for women has increased."[^41] In another *hadith*, he
says, "Whenever a person's love for women increases, his faith increases
in quality."[^42]

In a third hadith he relates the love for women to the love for
Ahlu'l-bayt which is an important teaching of the Qur'an. He says
"Whosoever's love for us increases, his love for women must also
increase."[^43] I do not think that there is any further need to prove
that Mernissi's accusation against Islam is baseless.

#### (D) Love Should be Exclusively Devoted to Allah

If asked that why does Islam consider love for women as a deadly enemy
of civilization and a danger to the social order, Mernissi would answer
that emotional investment or the focus of attention "should be devoted
to Allah alone in the form of knowledge-seeking, meditation, and
prayer."

This is what she describes as Ghazali's view.[^44] In other words,
Mernissi is saying that Islam, like Christianity, considers love for God
and love for woman as two antipathetic phenomena. However, to be fair to
Mernissi, I must say that this is a misconception from which even a
scholar like Ghazali is not immune.

Although I have already quoted in detail the Islamic view which believes
that love for women is not inharmonious with spiritual wayfaring, I
intend to discuss this issue in the light of what Ghazali, with his Sufi
tendencies, has to say.

### 2. Al-Ghazali’s Views

In his discussions on marriage in *Ihyau 'Ulumi 'd-Din,* Abu Hamid
al-Ghazali has a section on "Encouragement for Marriage" *(at-targhibfi
'n-nikah).* In this section he has quoted some sayings of the Prophet
about virtue of marriage. Then he has a section on "Discouragement from
Marriage" *(at-targhib 'ani 'n-nikah).*

In this section, apart from the sayings of some mystics (Sufis), Ghazali
has quoted three *hadith*: two from the Prophet and one from Imam 'Ali.
Interestingly, the third *hadith* is not even relevant to the issue; it
is more relevant to family planning it talks about having fewer wives
and children! Moreover, all three *ahadith* are classified by the
scholars of *hadith* as weak *(da'if)*[^45].

Then Ghazali goes on to discuss about the "benefits and harms of
marriage." Before scrutinizing the 'harms of marriage,' I wish to
comment on two *'ahadith'* of the Prophet which Ghazali has quoted from
his Sunni sources and which Mernissi has also used in her book.

The first *hadith* is as follows:

The Prophet said, "When the woman comes towards you, it is Satan who is
approaching you. When one of you sees a woman and he feels attracted to
her, he should hurry to his wife. With her, it would be the same as with
the other one."[^46]

After quoting this *hadith*, Mernissi adds the comments of Imam Muslim
that "She resembles Satan in his irresistible power over the
individual."

While discussing the issue of forgery or interpolation in *hadith*, our
*'ulama'* say that one source of forgery was the mystics and the
so-called pious mullahs who imported the idea of celibacy and
monasticism from without Islam into the *hadith* literature. And since
the evilness of woman is a main component of Christian monasticism,
similar ideas also crept into the *hadith* literatureeither in form of
total forgery or in form of interpolation.

When I read the above *'hadith'*, I suspected it to be an interpolation,
especially its opening sentence. My suspicion was confirmed when I
started to look for a similar *hadith* in the Shi'ah sources. The Shi'ah
sources narrate a similar hadith as follows:

The Prophet said, "When one of you sees a beautiful woman, he should go
to his wife. Because what is with her [i.e., wife] is same as what is
with the other one." (*Wasa'il,* vol. 14, p. 72-73) The same *hadith* is
also recorded with a slight difference: The Prophet said, "O Men! Verily
the act of seeing [a beautiful woman] is from Satan, therefore whoever
finds this inclination in him should go to his wife."[^47]

The *hadith* narrated from Sunni sources equates the woman to Satan,
whereas in the Shi'ah sources there is no such implication at all. On
the contrary, in the second version of the *hadith* found in the Shi'ah
sources, it is the man's sight which is related to the temptation by
Satan! If we have to choose between the sources of the Prophet's sunnah,
then we have no choice but to accept the version given by the Imams of
Ahlu'l-bayt, the family of the Prophet.

After all, no one could have known the Prophet better than the
Ahlu'l-bayt. In our view, Imam Ghazali, Imam Muslim and Mernissi are all
wrong in their attempt to equate woman with the Satan. The hadith they
have quoted has been interpolated, most probably, by the mystics to
encourage monasticism which they have imported from Christianity.

The second *hadith* is as follows: The Prophet said, "Do not go to the
women whose husbands are absent. Because Satan will get in your bodies
as blood rushes through your flesh”.[^48]

First of all, I was not able to find a similar *hadith* in the Shi'ah
sources. This, plus its content, cast doubt on the authenticity of the
*hadith*. Secondly, the source of this so-called *hadith* is *Sahih
at-Tirmidhi.* And I am surprised how Ghazali and Mernissi could use this
*hadith* while their source, Imam at-Tirmidhi, himself comments that
"This is a strange *hadith*!'' (haza hadithun gharib.)

Thirdly, even if the *hadith* is accepted, it does not prove what
Mernissi wants from it: "The married woman whose husband is absent is a
particular threat to men." This is because the *hadith* equates the men,
and not the women, with Satan. Actually, the women in this *hadith*
emerge as the victim of men who have been overwhelmed by the Satan!

\* \* \*

Now let us return to the work of Ghazali in which he is describing the
harms of marriage. Ghazali names three things as the harms of marriage
and we shall discuss each of them separately.

#### The First Harm

"The first and greatest harm [of marriage] is 'the inability to gain
lawful livelihood.' This is something which is not easy for everyone
especially during these times bearing in mind that livelihood is
necessary. Therefore, the marriage will be a cause for obtaining the
food by unlawful means, and in this is man's perdition and also that of
his family. Whereas a single person is free from these problems. .
."[^49]

Then he goes on to quote the mystics on this issue whose statements are
of no value to us unless they are based on the Qur'an and the *sunnah*.
They praise celibacy under the influence of monasticism which has been
condemned by the Prophet and the Qur'an.

The logical conclusion of what Ghazali and other mystics say is that 'if
you are rich, it is okay to marry; but if you are poor, you should not
marry otherwise you will end up seeking provision from unlawful means!'
This statement is totally against the Qur'anic view which says,

***"Marry the spouseless among you. . . if they are poor, God will
enrich them of His bounty."*** ***(24:32)***

***"Do not kill your children because of (fear of poverty We will
provide for you and them."*** ***(6: 152)***

The Prophet said, "Whoever refrains from marriage because of fear of
poverty, he has indeed thought badly of God."[^50]

I do not know how a person can gain spiritual upliftment by thinking
negatively about God's promise!

#### The Second Harm

"The inability [of men] to fulfill the wives' rights, to forebear their
[ill] manner and to bear patiently their annoyance."[^51]

What is Imam Ghazali saying? Does he mean that women in general are
over-demanding, ill-mannered and a nuisance? Can he really base this
view on the Qur'an and *sunnah* of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)?
I do not think so; and that is why we see that Ghazali has produced only
the sayings of some mystics in support of his views. And it is obvious
that this cannot be substantiated by the original Islamic sources.

#### The Third Harm

"The wife and children will distract him from Allah and attract him
towards seeking [the benefits of] this world and planning a good life
for his children by accumulating more wealth...And whatever distracts a
person from Allah whether wife, wealth or childrenis disastrous for
him."[^52]

If what Ghazali says is true, then not only marriage, but children,
friends, relatives and every material thing in this world must be
labeled as 'harmful' to a Muslim because all these have the potential of
distracting a person from God and the hereafter.

Here Ghazali sounds more like St. Paul! And if this is true, then a
Muslim should have nothing to do with this world, he should just confine
himself to a cave in an isolated jungle or desert and pray to God! The
absurdity of this idea from the Islamic point of view is obvious.

What Ghazali and other mystics say is not very much different from the
monastic ideas of the Christian Church. And, incidentally, they suffered
the same fate as the Christian monks. You have already read the comments
of 'Allamah Rizvi about the monks that "when the nature took its
revenge, the monks and abbots cultivated the idea that they were
representatives of Christ, and the nuns were given the titles of 'brides
of Christ.'

So with easy conscience they turned the monasteries into centres of
sexual liberties." (see previous) Similarly, when nature took its
revenge against the Sufis, in the words of 'Allamah Mutahhari, they
started to "derive [sexual] pleasure in company of handsome persons and
this work of theirs is considered as a journey towards Allah![^53]

The Sufis have a concept of *al-fanafi 'l-lah* which means 'obliteration
of the self into God'. In simple words, it means the spiritual
experience of becoming one with God. I am surprised how Ghazali can
consider marriage as a distraction from God when *fana* and obliteration
of two beings can be experienced in this world only in the sexual
context when husband and wife reach the climax and become one for a few
moments!

### 3. Love for God Vis-a-vis Love for this World

Imam Ghazali and other mystics have made a serious mistake in
understanding the concept of 'preparing for the hereafter'. And this is
what I would like to briefly clarify here. The concept of 'preparing for
the hereafter' depends on one's outlook about the relationship between
this world and the hereafter. There are three possibilities:

1. Submerge in the blessings of this world and forget the hereafter;

2. Utilize this world for the hereafter;

3. Forsake this world for the hereafter.

The mystics and Sufis have adopted the third alternative, whereas the
materialists have adopted the first alternative. Between these two
extremes, lies the true Islamic view. There are many verses of the
Qur'an which highly praise the blessings of this world, and many others
which strongly exhort the Muslims to seek the hereafter. Seen in
isolation, these verses can be used by the two groups to prove their
extreme views.

But seen in the light of other verses which talk about the
inter-relationship of this world and the hereafter, one is guided to the
Qur'anic view. And it is obvious that you cannot isolate the verses of
Qur'an from one another, especially if they are talking about the same
issue. As I said earlier, this is not the place to fully discuss this
issue, but I will give a few examples from the Qur'an and the *sunnah*
to clarify the Islamic view about this world and the hereafter.

The Qur'an says:

***"Seek, among that which God has given to you, the hereafter, but do
not forget your portion of this world either."*** ***(28:77)***

Allah says,

***"And when the prayer has ended, spread out in the world and seek the
blessings of Allah and remember Him often, haply you will succeed."***
***(62:10)***

Imam Hasan says, "Be for your world as if you are going to live forever,
and be for your hereafter as if you are going to die tomorrow."[^54] The
Imam is teaching you that Islam does not want you to forsake this world,
it wants you to totally benefit from it and love it but not to the
extent that you may forget the hereafter the hereafter, where your fate
depends on how obedient you were to God in your worldly life.

Imam Musa al-Kazim says, "The person who forsakes his world for the sake
of his religion or he who forsakes his religion for the sake of his
world is not from us."[^55] In Islam, piety does not mean forsaking this
world and living in isolation in a desert or a monastery! Piety means to
live a normal life in the society but without forgetting the ultimate
destination, the purpose of our creation an eternal life in the
hereafter.

\* \* \*

Even the relationship between the love for God and the love for one's
spouse, children, and the world at large is of the same type. There are
two levels of love in Islam: the love for God and the love for
everything else. Islam does not forbid a person to love the spouse,
children, parents, relatives, friends, and the worldly blessings which
Allah has given to him or her.

However, what Islam expects is that this love should be in harmony with
the love for God, it should be based on the love for God . The practical
implication of this is that if a conflict occurs between the demand of
the love for God and the love for anything else, then the love for God
should take precedence. In Islam, God is the axis of existence, He and
nothing else is the Absolute Truth.

Allow me to explain this phenomenon in a metaphorical manner: the moon
revolves around the earth, but at the same time, it also revolves around
the sun. Moreover, the magnetic relationship between the moon and the
earth is a minor part of the overall magnetic force which makes the
planets revolve around the sun in our solar system.

Similarly, in Islam the love between two human beings is like the
relationship of the moon and the earth; and the love which a Muslim has
for God is like the relationship of the sun and the planets. Obviously,
the first type of love exists within the realm of the second. In other
words, there are two cycles of love: love for God and love for one's
husband, wife or children. The first is a wider circle within which
exists the second circle of love.

Remember, there is a fine difference between what we are saying and what
Mernissi and, to some extent, Ghazali have said. Mernissi says that in
Islam love between husband and wife is forbidden because love should be
devoted to God alone.

Whereas we are saying that Islam does not forbid love between husband
and wife or love for anything else as long as it is in harmony with the
love for God. That is, it should not overwhelm you to the extent of
forsaking the love for God. This is clearly mentioned in the Qur'an:

***Say (O Muhammad), "If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your
wives, your clan, (your) possessions which you have acquired, (your)***
***business which you fear may slacken and (your)dwellings which you
love (if these) are dearer to you than Allah, His Messenger and
struggling in His way, then wait till Allah brings about His decision
(on the day of judgement)."*** ***(9:24)***

I would like to emphasize on the word "ahabbu dearer." If Allah had said
that "if your...are dear to you" than Mernissi or others of her ideology
might have been right in saying that Islam expects exclusive love for
Allah and that all other loves are forbidden.

But here Allah is talking in a comparative manner and says that if you
love other things or persons more than Allah, then you are wrong,
because such love could take you on the path of disobedience to the
commands of Allah and cause your perdition in the hereafter.

It is clear from what we said above that the Islamic concept of love is
not confined to love for God vis-a-vis love for women, it is a universal
concept in which we talk about love for all persons and things. So it is
absolutely misleading to give a sexist context to this issue and say
that the Islamic sexual morality is an anti-women morality.

In conclusion, we can say that the views of Mernissi and Ghazali that in
Islam women are sexually more active than men and that Islam does not
tolerate love between husband and wife cannot be substantiated from the
original Islamic sources, the Qur'an and the authentic *sunnah*.

C. Criterion of Moral and Immoral
---------------------------------

We have said earlier that Islam does not agree with the suppression of
sexual urges, rather it promotes their fulfilment. But at the same time
we have been emphasizing that it must be done in a responsible and
lawful way. In other words, we have hinted that according to Islam
sexual urges can be fulfilled in two ways: lawful and unlawful or moral
and immoral.

What is the criterion of moral and immoral in the Islamic morality?
Islam, like any other religion or ideology, has certain fundamental
beliefs and all its teachings must be in harmony with its fundamentals.
The foundation of Islam is the faith in One God, not just as the Creator
but also as the Law-Giver. The Qur'an is not just a book of spiritual
guidance it is also a source of laws regulating our daily life. "Islam,"
after all, means "submission to the will of God" The Qur'an says clearly
that

***"It is not for any believer man or woman, when God and His Messenger
have decreed a matter, to have the choice in the affair. Whosoever
disobeys God and His Messenger has gone astray into manifest error."(33
:36)***

So in Islam, the right and the wrong, the moral and the immoral, the
lawful and the unlawful is decided by Allah and His Messenger. And, in
our view, the Imams of Ahlu'l-bayt are the best commentators of the
Qur'an, the protectors of the authentic sunnah and living examples of
the teachings of Islam.

In short, the criteria of lawful and unlawful in Islam are the Qur'an,
the authentic sunnah of the Prophet and his Ahlu'l-bayt. The Shi'ah
faith also emphasizes that whatever Allah has decreed as lawful and
unlawful is based on a reason, material or spiritual or both.

However, God is Omniscient whereas we are still at the shallow end of
the deep ocean of knowledge, therefore it is not always possible for us
to understand the rationale behind each and every command of God. The
basic concept of sexual morality that sex is not evil and should not be
suppressed is a very obvious example of an Islamic teaching which is in
complete harmony with human reason and nature.

As soon as we say that Islam believes in regulating our sexual behavior,
we are confronted with the question about (1) regulating sex by morality
and (2) personal freedom in sexual behavior. These are the two issues
which we intend to discuss briefly before closing this chapter.

### 1. Regulating Sex by Morality

The first question is, "Can sexuality be regulated by morality?" We are
told that "there cannot really be such a thing as a specifically sexual
morality. Morality attaches not to the sexual act, but always to
something else, with which it may be conjoined.

We may reasonably forbid sexual violence, say, but that is on account of
the violence; considered in and for itself, and detached from fortuitous
circumstances, the sexual act is neither right nor wrong, but merely
'natural'.''[^56] The conclusion of this idea is simple: since there can
be no real sexual morality, therefore, there should be no restrain,
whatsoever, in sexual gratification. Nothing should be considered
immoral or unlawful!

This idea by itself is absurd. Sexuality is an act which mostly involves
two persons, and whenever two persons are involved even on secular
basis, laws and regulations become necessary to regulate their behavior.

To provide a rational basis for this idea it is sometimes said that many
nervous and mental disorders take place because of the feeling of sexual
deprivation. The preventive measure for such nervous and mental
disorders is unrestrained gratification of sexual instinct. What they
want to say in simple words is that the more you restrict sex, the more
people will be attracted towards it and suffer the feeling of
deprivation.

The libertine culture of the West actually enforced the unrestrained
sexual behavior in the West during last thirty years. And, by keeping in
mind the above arguments, one would expect to see a decline in the
number of nervous disorders, sexual frustration, rape, incest, child
abuse, and sexual assault.

But has this really happened? No, of course, not! A look at the
statistics shows that all the so-called effects of sexual deprivation
have increased manifold in spite of the unrestrained sexual mood of the
60s, 70s and 80s!

What actually happened was that the Western world, after revolting
against the suppression of sex by the Christian system, mistook
unrestrained sex for nurtured sex. Islam does not accept the idea of
suppressing the sexual instincts; instead it encourages the nurturing of
those feelings and fulfilling them in a responsible way.

Whatever restrictions Islam imposes on sex are based on the idea of
nurturing it. It is not different from the way we fulfil the desire for
food: you must eat, but not overfeed yourself. Similarly you must fulfil
your sexual desires, but not at the expense of the rights of others and
of your own body.

After rebelling against the suppressive sexual morality of the Church,
the libertarian culture went to the other extreme of absolutely
unrestrained sex. They made a big mistake in thinking that restrictions,
in any form, were unnatural and wrong. Even Bertrand Russell, who
strongly supports the libertarian view, had to accept that some
restrictions in sexual morality are necessary.

He writes, "I am not suggesting that there should be no morality and no
self-restraint in regard to sex, any more than in regard to food. In
regard to food we have restraints of three kinds, those of law, those of
manners, and those of health.

We regard it wrong to steal food, to take more than our share at a
common meal, and to eat in ways that are likely to make us ill.
Restraints of a similar kind are essential where sex is concerned, but
in this case they are much more complex and involve much more
self-control."[^57]

Russell, however, had difficulty in finding a new basis for sexual
morality. The dilemma which the Western world is facing at the present
time is very eloquently reflected in what Russell has written. He says,
"If we are to allow the new morality [of unrestrained sex] to take its
course, it is bound to go further than it has done, and to raise
difficulties hardly as yet appreciated.

If, on the other hand, we attempt in the modern world to enforce
restrictions which were possible in a former [Christian] age, we are led
into an impossible stringency of regulation, against which human nature
would soon rebel. This is so clear that, whatever the dangers or
difficulties, we must be content to let the world go forward rather than
back.

For this purpose we shall need a genuinely new morality. I mean by this
that obligations and duties will still have to be recognized, though
they may be very different from the obligations and duties recognized in
the past.

I do not think that the new system any more than the old should involve
an unbridled yielding to impulse, but I think the occasions for
restraining impulse and the motives for doing so will have to be
different from what they have been in the past.''[^58]

If Russell had an opportunity to study Islam closely, I am sure he would
have found in it "a genuinely new morality" which regulated sex without
leading into "an impossible stringency of regulation."

### 2. Islam & Personal Freedom

The second question with which we are confronted by secularists and
liberals is that of personal freedom: "Am I not free to do whatever I
like as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others?"

I think it will be very helpful to point out the main difference between
Islam and the secular, liberal idea of personal freedom. In the secular
system, the rights are divided into two: rights of an individual and
rights of the society. A person is free to do whatever he or she likes
as long as it does not infringe upon the rights of other people. To
become an acceptable member of society, one has to accept this
limitation on his or her freedom.

An individual's freedom is only restricted by the freedom of others.
Islam, on the other hand, divides the rights into three: rights of an
individual, rights of the society, and rights of God. A person is free
to do whatever he or she likes as long as it does not violate the rights
of other people and God. To become a Muslim, one has to accept this
limitation on his or her personal freedom.

One more important difference is in the concept of individual's right.
In secular usage, individual's rights are seen in contrast to those of
the other members of society. Islam goes one step further and says that
even the body of an individual has some rights against the person
himself. In other words, Islam holds a person responsible even for the
use of his or her body. You are not allowed to abuse your own body or
harm it. Allah says,

***"The hearing, the sight, the heart all of these shall be questioned
of."*** ***(17:38)***

Describing the day of judgement, He says,

***"On the day when their tongues, their hands, and their feet shall
bear witness against them as to what they were doing."*** ***(24:24)***

***"On that day We will put a seal upon their mouths, and their hands
shall speak to Us and their feet shall bear witness of what they were
earning."*** ***(36:65)***

Imam Zaynu'l-'Abidn, in his *Risalatu 'l-Huquq,* describes the rights
which a person's tongue, ears, eyes, feet, hands, stomach and sexual
parts have on him. If a person misuses or abuses his body, then he is
guilty of infringing the rights of his own body and also the rights of
God who has given the body as a trust to us. The Qur'an says,

***"The believers are...those who protect their sexual organs except
from their spouse's. . . Therefore, whosoever seeks more beyond that in
sexual gratification], then they are the transgressors."*** ***(23:
5-6)***

In Islam, an individual's rights are not limited only by rights of the
society but also by those of his own body and God. The justification for
this is very simple: Islam does not allow a person to harm or destroy
himself; and sin or immorality is a means of perdition. This limitation
is based on the love and concern which the Merciful God has for us.

***"Allah does not desire to make any impediment for you, but He desires
to purify you and to complete His blessings upon you."*** ***(5:6)***

The Islamic concept of personal freedom may seem restrictive when
compared to that of the secular system, but its rationale and
justification is accepted, in an indirect way, even by the secular
society. The logical consequences of the secular idea of personal
freedom is that a person is allowed to do whatever he likes with
himself; the only limitation is that he should not infringe upon the
rights of others.

But the West has not been able to totally swallow this idea as can be
seen in the laws which place restrictions on certain acts, for example,
suicide or using narcotic drugs and also the mandatory use of car
seat-belts. By using narcotic drugs, the addict is not infringing upon
the rights of othersunless.

Of course, the meaning of infringing upon others' rights is stretched to
include spiritual values which are not part of the secular realmbut
still the Western society considers it unlawful and takes steps to
prevent the addicts from using drugs. This is justified by saying that
it is the society's duty to prevent its citizens from harming
themselves.

In these examples, we see that the secular system is retreating from the
logical consequences of its version of individual freedom. The only
difference remaining between the secular and the Islamic views is that
the former gives the right of restricting to the society while the
latter view gives that right to God.

In conclusion, we may say that the Islamic view forbids not only the
acts which infringe upon the rights of others but also those which
infringe upon the rights of the person's own body. This view is based on
the love and concern which Allah has for human beings.
