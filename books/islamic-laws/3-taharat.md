Pure and Mixed Water
--------------------

***Issue*** 15: Water is either pure or mixed. Mixed water (Ma'ul muzaf)
means the water which is obtained from something like melon juice, or
rose water, or that water in which something else is mixed, (for
example, so much dust is mixed in it that it may no longe r be called
water).

Any water other than mixed water is called pure water (Ma'ul mutlaq),
and they are of five types:

• Kurr Water,

• Under-Kurr Water, (QALEEL)

• Running Water, (JAREE)

• Rain Water,

• Water of a Well.

### I. Kurr water

###

***Issue*** 16: \* Water, which fills a container whose length, breadth
and depth are three and half spans each, is equal to a Kurr. Based on
this, the volume of water will be 42.875 cubic span, though 36 cubic
span is enough. To determine KURR by weight is not fre e from Ishkal.

***Issue*** 17: If essential Najasat like urine, blood, or anything
which has become najis, like a najis cloth, falls in Kurr Water and if
the water acquires the smell, colour, or taste of that najasat, it
becomes najis; but if it does not, then it is not najis.

***Issue*** 18: If the smell, colour, or taste of Kurr water changes
owing to something else, which is not najis, it does not become najis.

***Issue*** 19: If an essential najasat like blood etc. reaches water
which is more than a Kurr, and changes the smell, colour, or taste of a
part of it, if the unchanged part is less than a Kurr, the entire water
becomes najis. But if the unchanged part is one Kurr or more, then only
that part which has changed will be najis.

***Issue*** 20: If water of a spring is connected to Kurr, the water of
the spring will make najis water Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But if it falls
on the najis water drop by drop, it will not make it Clean (*tahir/pak*
), except when something is placed over the spring, so that before the
drops are form ed, it connects the najis water. Better still, if the
water of the spring is totally merged with the najis water.

***Issue*** 21: If a najis object is washed under a tap which is
connected with Kurr, and if water which flows from that object remains
connected with Kurr, and does not contain the smell, colour, or taste of
the najasat or essential najasat, that water will be Clean (*tahir/pak*
).

***Issue*** 22: If a part of Kurr water freezes to ice, leaving a
quantity which is not equal to a Kurr, and then najasat reaches it, it
will become najis, and water obtained from the melting ice also will be
najis.

***Issue*** 23: If the quantity of water was equal to a Kurr and later
on, if someone doubts whether it has reduced to less than a Kurr, it
will be treated to be equal to a Kurr, i.e. it will make a najis object
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and will not become najis if najasat reaches it. A
nd if water was less than a

Kurr, and one suspects that it may have become equal to a Kurr, it will
be treated as under-Kurr water.

***Issue*** 24: \* There are two ways of establishing that the quantity
of water is equal to a Kurr:

a person should be sure about it himself,

two men who are just, should say so.

### II. Under-Kurr Water

###

***Issue*** 25: Under-Kurr water means water which does not spring forth
from the earth, and its quantity is less than a Kurr.

***Issue*** 26: If under-Kurr water is poured on something which is
najis, or if a najis thing contacts it, it becomes najis. But, if such
water is poured with force on a najis object, only that part which
contacts it will be najis, and the water which has not reach ed the
najis object, will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 27: \* Under-Kurr water which is poured over a najis object
to remove the essential najasat will be najis, as it flows after the
contact. Similarly, the under-Kurr water which is poured over a najis
thing to wash it after the essential najasat has been removed, will be
najis, as an obligatory precaution.

***Issue*** 28: \* The water with which the outlets of urine and stool
are washed, does not make anything najis, subject to the following five
conditions:

• It does not have the smell, colour or taste of najasat.

• Extra najasat has not reached it from outside.

• Any other najasat like blood, has not come out with urine or stool.

• Particles of stool do not appear in the water.

• More than usual najasat has not spread around the outlet.

### III. Running Water

###

***Issue*** 29: Running water is that water which springs forth from the
earth and then flows, like the water of a spring or a canal.The flowing
or running water, even if it is less than Kurr, does not become najis
upon contact with any najasat, unless its smell, co lour, or taste
changes due to that najasat.

***Issue*** 30: If najasat reaches the running water, only that part of
the water will be najis whose smell, colour, or taste changes on account
of it, and that end which is connected with the spring will be Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) even if it may be less than a Kurr. Similarly, the wat er
on the other side of the canal will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ), if it is
equal to a Kurr, or if it is connected with the water near the spring
through unchanged water. If not, then it would be najis.

***Issue*** 31: \* A spring which does not run or flow, but replaces
water every time water is drawn from it, will not be treated as running
water. That means if najasat reaches it, and if it is less than Kurr, it
will become najis.

***Issue*** 32: \* If water at the bank of a canal is stationary, but is
connected with running water, it will not be considered as running
water.

***Issue*** 33: If a spring is active in winter, but remains dormant in
summer, it will be treated as running water only when it is active.

***Issue*** 34: If the water in a pool or tank of a public bath (Hammam)
is less than a Kurr, but is connected with a store of water which when
added to it

becomes equal to a Kurr, it does not become najis by meeting najasat if
its smell, colour, or taste does not ch ange.

***Issue*** 35: If water from the pipes fitted in bathrooms and
buildings, pouring through taps and showers, is connected to a tank
holding water equal to a Kurr, it will be treated as Kurr water.

***Issue*** 36: Any water which flows but does not gush from a source,
will become najis on contacting najasat, if it is less than Kurr. But if
water flows with force and najasat touches it at the end part below, the
upper end will not become najis.

### IV. Rain Water

###

***Issue*** 37: \* A najis thing becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) if rain
water falls on it once, provided that it does not contain an essential
najasat, except in the cases of clothes and body which have become najis
because of urine, for they become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) after being
washed twice, as p er precaution. And in objects like carpets and dress,
it is not necessary to wring or squeeze. By rain is meant a sufficient
downpour, and not scanty shower or droplets.

***Issue*** 38: \* If rain water falls on Najisul Ayn and splashes
elsewhere, and if the essential najasat is not found in the water, nor
does it acquire the smell, colour, or taste of the najasat, then that
water is Clean (*tahir/pak* ). So, if it rains on blood and then
splashes, and particles of blood are seen in the water, or it acquires
the smell, colour, or taste of blood, it is najis.

***Issue*** 39: If there is Najisul Ayn on the roof of a building, and
water flows down from the roof after contacting the najis object, it
will be deemed Clean (*tahir/pak* ) as long as the rain continues. But
if it continues to flow down the same way after contacting the najis obj
ect, after the rain has stopped, that water will be najis.

***Issue*** 40: The najis earth or ground on which rain falls becomes
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and if it begins flowing on the ground, and while
it is still raining it reaches a najis place under the roof, it makes
that place Clean (*tahir/pak* ) as well.

***Issue*** 41: \* If rain water falls on najis dust or sand, soaking it
thoroughly, it becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 42: \* If rain water collects at a place, even if its
quantity is less than a Kurr, and a najis thing is washed in it while it
is raining, it becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) provided that, it does not
assume the smell, colour, or taste of that najasat.

***Issue*** 43: \* If it rains on a pure carpet which is spread over a
najis ground, and if the water seeps onto the najis ground while rain
continues, the carpet does not become najis. In fact, the ground also
will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

### V. Well Water

###

***Issue*** 44: The water of a well which springs forth from the earth,
(although its quantity may be less than a Kurr) does not become najis
owing to something najis falling in it, unless its colour, smell, or
taste changes. However, it is recommended that, in the event of certain
najasat falling in it, a quantity of water should be drawn from the
well. Details about this quantity are given in the relevant books.

***Issue*** 45: If a najasat falls into well water and changes its
smell, colour, or taste, it will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) as soon as
the change in its smell etc. vanishes. But it is better to wait till it
is mixed with the fresh water springing from the earth.

***Issue*** 46: If rain water is collected in a hole, and its quantity
is less than a Kurr, it will become najis if najasat reaches it after
the rain has stopped.

Rules Regarding Waters:
-----------------------

***Issue*** 47: Mixed water, whose meaning has been explained in Article
15, does not make any najis thing Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and its use is
not allowed for Ghusl or Wudhu.

***Issue*** 48: \* Mixed water, however large its quantity may be,
becomes najis when even a small particle of najasat falls in it. But, if
it falls on a najis thing from above, with some force, the part which
touches the najasat will become najis, and the part whic h does not
touch it, will remain Clean (*tahir/pak* ). For example, if rose water
is sprinkled on a najis hand from a sprinkler, the part which reaches
the hand will be najis and the part which does not reach the hand, will
remain Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 49: When najis mixed water is mixed with Kurr or running
water, in a manner that it can no longer be called mixed water, it
becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 50: Water which was originally pure and it is not known
whether it has turned into mixed water, will be treated as pure, i.e. it
will make najis thing Clean (*tahir/pak* ) and it will also be in order
to perform Wudhu and Ghusl with it. But if it was originally mixed wa
ter, and it is not known whether it has turned into pure water, it will
be treated as mixed water, i.e. it will not make najis objects Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), and it cannot be used for Wudhu or Ghusl.

***Issue*** 51: \* Water about which it is not known whether it is pure
or mixed, and it is also not known whether originally it was pure or
mixed, will not make najis things Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and it is also
not permissible to perform Wudhu or Ghusl with it. Also, it becomes naj
is when a najasat reaches it, even if it is equal to a Kurr or more.

***Issue*** 52: \* When an essential najasat like blood and urine
reaches water, and changes its smell, colour, or taste,it becomes najis
even if it is Kurr or running water. Similarly, if the smell, colour, or
taste of the water changes owing to a najasat which is outside it—for
example, if a carcass, which is lying by the side of the water, causes a
change in smell, the water will be deemed najis, as an obligatory
precaution.

***Issue*** 53: \* If water which has become najis due to Najisul Ayn
like blood or urine, which changed its smell, colour, or taste, joins
Kurr-water or running water, or if rain water falls on it, or is blown
over it by the winds, or rain water falls on it through the drain pipe
while it is raining, the water will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) if the
change vanishes. However, rain water, or Kurr water, or running water
should get mixed with it.

***Issue*** 54: If a najis object is made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) in Kurr
or running water, the water which falls from the object after it has
become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 55: Water, which was originally Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and it
is not known whether it has become najis, will be deemed Clean
(*tahir/pak* ); and water, which was originally najis, and it is not
known whether it has become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), is najis.

***Issue*** 56: The leftover of a dog, a pig and a kafir, other than the
people of the Book,is najis, and as a recommended precaution, the
leftover of the people of the Book is also najis, and it is haraam to
consume it. However,

the leftover of the animals, whose m eat is haraam, is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), and with the exception of cat, it is Makrooh to eat or
drink the leftover of a such animals.

Rules concerning Use of Lavatory
--------------------------------

***Issue*** 57: \* It is obligatory to conceal one's private parts in
the toilet and at all times from adult persons even if they are one's
near relatives (like mother, sister etc.) Similarly, it is obligatory to
conceal one's private parts from insane persons, and from children who
can discern between good and evil. However, husband and wife are
exempted from this obligation.

***Issue*** 58: It is not necessary for a person to conceal the private
parts with any definite thing, it is sufficient, if, for example, he
conceals them with his hand.

***Issue*** 59: \* While using the toilet for relieving oneself, the
front or the back part of one's body should not face the holy Ka'bah.

***Issue*** 60: \* If a person sits in the toilet with the front part of
his body or the back facing the Qibla, but turns the private parts away
from that direction, it will not be enough. Similarly, when the front
part of the body or the back does not face Qibla, as a precaution, he
should not allow the private parts to face that direction.

***Issue*** 61: Recommended precaution is that one should not face the
Qibla or have one's back towards it at the time of Istibra (to be
explained later), nor at the time of washing oneself to become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) after relief.

***Issue*** 62: \* When one is forced to sit facing the Qibla, or with
his back towards it, so as to avoid somebody looking at him, or if it is
not possible to do so, or when there is an unavoidable excuse for
sitting that way, it is permissible to do so.

***Issue*** 63: It is a recommended precaution that even a child should
not be made to sit in the toilet with its face or back facing Qibla. But
if the child positions itself that way, it is not obligatory to divert
it.

***Issue*** 64: It is haraam to relieve oneself at the following four
places:

• In blind alleys, without the permission of the people who live there.

• On the property (land) of a person who has not granted permission for
the purpose.

• At a place which is waqf exclusively for its beneficiaries, like some
Madrassahs.

• On the graves of Momineen, and at the sacred places whose sanctity
will thus be violated.

***Issue*** 65: In the following three cases, anus can be made Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) with water alone:

• If another najasat, like blood, appears along with the faeces.

• If an external najasat reaches the anus.

• If more than usual najasat spreads around the anus.

In the cases other than those mentioned above, anus can be made Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) either by water or by using cloth, or stone etc.,
although it is always better to wash it with water. (for details: see
Notes 68 - 70).

***Issue*** 66: \* The urinary organ cannot be made Clean (*tahir/pak* )
without water. If one uses kurr or running water, then washing the organ
once will suffice, after removal of essential najasat. But, if one uses
under-kurr water, then recommended precaution is to wash it twice,
better still, three times.

***Issue*** 67: If the anus is washed with water, one should ensure that
no trace of faeces is left on it. However, there is no harm if colour
and smell

remain. And if it is washed thoroughly in the first instance, leaving no
particle of stool, then it is not necess ary to wash it again.

***Issue*** 68: The anus can be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with stone,
clod or cloth provided they are dry and Clean (*tahir/pak* ). If there
is slight moisture on it, which does not reach the outlet, there is no
objection.

***Issue*** 69: \* If one makes oneself totally Clean (*tahir/pak* )
with stone, clod or cloth once, it will be enough, though it is better
to do it three times. In fact, it is better to use three pieces. And if
one does not get totally Clean (*tahir/pak* ) after three times, he may
continue till he is Clean (*tahir/pak* ). However, there in no harm, if
invisible, tiny particles are still there.

***Issue*** 70: It is haraam to make the anus Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with
things which are sacred and revered, like, a paper on which the names of
Allah and the Prophets are written. And using bones or dung for the
purpose, may not make the place Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 71: If a person doubts whether he has made the outlet Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), it is necessary that he should make it Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) even if he may have been doing it always as a matter of
habit.

***Issue*** 72: \* When a person doubts after Salat, whether he made the
outlet Clean (*tahir/pak* ) before he started the prayers, the Salat
already prayed will be valid, but for the ensuing prayers, he will make
himself Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

### Istibra

###

***Issue*** 73: Istibra is a recommended act for men after urinating.
Its object is to ensure that no more urine is left in the urethra.

There are certain ways of performing Istibra, and the best of them is
that after the passing of urine, if the anus also becomes najis it is
made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) first. Thereafter, the part between the anus
and the root of penis should be pressed thrice, with the mid dle finger
of the left hand. Then the thumb is placed on the penis, and the
forefinger below it pressing three times up to the point of
circumcision, then the front part of the penis should be jerked three
times.

***Issue*** 74: The moisture which is discharged by man during wooing
and courtship, is called 'Mazi'. It is Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and so is
the liquid which is seen after ejaculation. It is called 'Wazi'.
Similarly, the liquid which at times comes out after urine, is called
'Wadi' and it is Clean (*tahir/pak* ) if urine has not reached it. If a
person performs Istibra after urinating, and then discharges liquid
doubting whether it is urine, or one of the above mentioned three
liquids, that liquid is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 75: If a person doubts whether he has performed Istibra or
not, and then discharges a liquid about which he is not sure whether it
is Clean (*tahir/pak* ) or not, that liquid is will be deemed najis, and
if he has performed Wudhu it becomes void. However, if he doubts whe
ther he performed the Istibra correctly or not, and a liquid is
discharged about which he is not sure whether it is Clean (*tahir/pak* )
or not, that liquid will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and it will not
invalidate the Wudhu.

***Issue*** 76: \* If a person performs Istibra, and also performs
Wudhu, and if after Wudhu he sees a liquid discharged, of which he knows
that it is either urine or semen, it will be obligatory upon him to do
Ghusl, together with

Wudhu. But if he had not done Wudh u after Istibra, then Wudhu alone
will be sufficient.

***Issue*** 77: When enough time has lapsed since urinating, and one
becomes sure that no urine is left in urinary passage, and then he sees
some liquid, doubting whether it is Clean (*tahir/pak* ) or not, he will
consider it as Clean (*tahir/pak* ), even if he had not done Istibra. If
he has Wudhu, it will be valid.

***Issue*** 78: Istibra is not meant for women, and if she sees any
liquid and she doubts whether it is urine, that liquid is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), and it will not invalidate Wudhu and Ghusl.

### Mustahab and Makrooh Acts

###

***Issue*** 79: It is Mustahab that a person sitting for relieving
himself, sits at a place where no one would see him, and enters the
toilet with his left foot forward, and comes out with his right foot. It
is also Mustahab to cover one's head, and to place one's w eight on the
left foot.

***Issue*** 80: It is Makrooh to face the sun, or the moon, while
relieving oneself. But if a person manages to cover his private parts,
it will not be Makrooh. Moreover, it is Makrooh to sit for urinating
etc. facing the wind; or on the road side, or in lanes, or in front of a
doors of a house or under the shade of the fruit-yielding tree. It is
also Makrooh to eat while relieving oneself, or take longer then usual
time, or to wash oneself with the right hand. Talking is also Makrooh
unless necessary. To utter words remembering Allah is not Makrooh.

***Issue*** 81: It is Makrooh to urinate while standing, or on hard
earth, or in the burrows of the animals, or in stationery water.

***Issue*** 82: It is Makrooh to suppress or constrain one's urge for
urine or excretion, and if it is injurious to one's health, it becomes
haraam.

***Issue*** 83: It is Mustahab to urinate before Salat, before retiring
to sleep, before sexual intercourse, and after ejaculation.

Najis Things
------------

***Issue*** 84: \* The following ten things are essentially najis:

• Urine

• Faeces

• Semen

• Dead body

• Blood

• Dog

• Pig

• Kafir

• Alcoholic liquors

• The sweat of an animal who persistently eats najasat.

### Urine and Faeces

###

***Issue*** 85: \* Urine and faeces of the following living beings are
najis:

• Human beings

• Animals whose meat is haraam to eat, and whose blood gushes out
forcefully when its large vein (jugular) is slit.

The excretion of those animals who are haraam to eat, but its blood does
not gush forth forcefully when killed, like haraam fish, is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). Similarly, droppings of mosquito and flies are Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). Of course, the urine of an animal whose meat is haraam,
should be avoided as per obligatory precaution, even if its blood does
not gush forth when killed.

***Issue*** 86: The urine and droppings of those birds which are haraam
to eat, is Clean (*tahir/pak* ), but it is better to avoid them.

***Issue*** 87: \* The urine and excretion of an animal who subsists on
najasat, and of a goat who was nursed by a pig, and of a quadruped who
has been defiled by a human being, are najis.

### Semen

###

***Issue*** 88: The semen of human beings, and of every animal whose
blood gushes when its large vein (jugular) is cut, is najis.

### Dead Body

###

***Issue*** 89: The dead body of a human being is najis. Similarly the
dead body of any animal whose blood gushes forth with force is najis,
irrespective of whether it dies a natural death, or is killed in a
manner other than that prescribed by Islam. As the blood o f a fish does
not gush forth, its dead body is Clean (*tahir/pak* ), even if it dies
in water.

***Issue*** 90: Those parts of a dead body which do not contain life
like, wool, hair, teeth, nails, bones and horns are Clean (*tahir/pak*
).

***Issue*** 91: If flesh, or any other part which contains life, is cut
off from the body of a living human being, or a living animal whose
blood gushes forth, it will be najis.

***Issue*** 92: Small pieces of skin which peel off from the lips, or
other parts of the body, are Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 93: \* An egg from the body of a dead hen, is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), but its exterior must be washed.

***Issue*** 94: If a lamb or a kid dies before it is able to graze, the
rennet (cheese) found in its stomach is Clean (*tahir/pak* ), but its
exterior should be washed with water.

***Issue*** 95: The liquid medicines, perfumes, ghee, soap and wax
polish which are imported, are Clean (*tahir/pak* ), if one is not sure
of their being najis.

***Issue*** 96: Fat, meat or hide of an animal, about which there is a
probability that it may have been slaughtered according to the Islamic
law, are Clean (*tahir/pak* ). However, if these things are obtained
from a non-Muslim, or from a Muslim who himself obtained them from a
non -Muslim, without investigating whether the animal was slaughtered
according to Islamic law, it is haraam to eat that meat and fat, but
Salat in that hide will be permissible. But, if these things are
obtained from Muslim Bazaar, or a Muslim, and it is not known that he
got them from a non-Muslim, or if it is known that he got from a
non-Muslim but there is a great probability that he has investigated
about it being slaughtered according to Shariah, then eating such meat
and fat is permissible.

### Blood

###

***Issue*** 97: The blood of a human being, and of every animal whose
blood gushes forth when its large vein is cut, is najis. The blood of an
animal like a fish, or an insect like mosquito, is Clean (*tahir/pak* )
because it does not gush forth..

***Issue*** 98: \* If an animal whose meat is halal to eat, is
slaughtered in accordance with the method prescribed by Shariah, and
enough blood flows out, the blood of which is still left in its body is
Clean (*tahir/pak* ). However, the blood which goes back into the body
of the a nimal due to breath, or because of its head having been at a
higher level at the time of its slaughtering, is najis.

***Issue*** 99: As a recommended precaution, one should refrain from
eating an egg which has even the smallest amount of blood in it.
However, if the blood is in the yolk (yellow potion) the albumen (white
portion) will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ), as long as the skin over the yolk
is not torn.

***Issue*** 100: The blood which is sometimes seen while milking an
animal, is najis, and makes the milk najis.

***Issue*** 101: If the blood which comes from inside the teeth,
vanishes as it gets mixed with the saliva, the saliva is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 102: \* If the blood which dries under the nail or skin, on
account of being hurt, can no longer be called blood, it is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). But if it is blood and is seen as such, then it is
najis. And if a hole appears in the nail or the skin, and if it is
difficult t o remove the blood and to make it Clean (*tahir/pak* ) for
the purpose of Wudhu or Ghusl, then one should perform*tayammum* .

***Issue*** 103: If a person cannot discern whether it is dried blood
under the skin, or that the flesh has turned that way because of being
hit, it is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 104: \* Even a small particle of blood falling in the food,
while it is being boiled, will make the entire food together with its
container najis, as

per obligatory precaution, and boiling, heat, or fire does not make it
Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 105: When a wound is healing, and pus forms around it, that
substance is Clean (*tahir/pak* ) if it is not known to have been mixed
with blood.

### Dogs and Pigs

###

***Issue*** 106: The dogs and pigs which live on land are najis, and
even their hair, bones, paws and nails, and every liquid substance of
their body, is najis. However, sea dogs and pigs are Clean (*tahir/pak*
).

### Kafir

###

***Issue*** 107: \* An infidel i.e. a person who does not believe in
Allah and His Oneness, is najis. Similarly, Ghulat who believe in any of
the holy twelve Imams as God, or that they are incarnations of God, and
Khawarij and Nawasib who express enmity towards th e holy Imams, are
also najis. And similar is the case of those who deny Prophethood, or
any of the necessary laws of Islam, like, Salat and fasting, which are
believed by the Muslims as a part of Islam, and which they also know as
such.

As regards the people of the Book (i.e. the Jews and the Christians) who
do not accept the Prophethood of Prophet Muhammad bin Abdullah (Peace be
upon him and his progeny), they are commonly considered najis, but it is
not improbable that they are Clean (*tahir/pak* ). Ho wever, it is
better to avoid them.

***Issue*** 108: The entire body of a Kafir, including his hair and
nails, and all liquid substances of his body, are najis.

***Issue*** 109: \* If the parents, paternal grandmother and paternal
grandfather of a minor child are all kafir, that child is najis, except
when he is intelligent enough, and professes Islam. When, even one
person from his parents or grandparents is a Muslim, the child is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) (The details will be explained in rule 217).

***Issue*** 110: \* A person about whom it is not known whether he is a
Muslim or not, and if no signs exist to establish him as a Muslim, he
will be considered Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But he will not have the
privileges of a Muslim, like, he cannot marry a Muslim woman, nor can he
be buried in a Muslim cemetery.

***Issue*** 111: Any person who abuses any of the twelve holy Imams on
account of enmity, is najis.

### Alcoholic Liquor

###

***Issue*** 112: \* All Alcoholic liquors and beverages which intoxicate
a person, are najis and on the basis of recommended precaution,
everything which is originally liquid and intoxicates a person, is
najis. Hence narcotics, like, opium and hemp, which are not li quid
originally, are Clean (*tahir/pak* ), even when a liquid is added to
them.

***Issue*** 113: All kinds of industrial alcohol used for painting
doors, windows, tables, chairs etc. are Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 114: If grapes or grape juice ferments by itself, or on
being cooked, they are Clean (*tahir/pak* ), but it is haraam to eat or
drink them.

***Issue*** 115: If dates, currants and raisins, and their juice
ferment, they are Clean (*tahir/pak* ) and it is halal to eat them.

### Beer (Fuqa')

###

***Issue*** 116: \* Beer, which is prepared from barley, and is called
'Ab-i-Jaw', is haraam, but there is Ishkal in it being najis. But barley
water which is medically prepared, and is called 'Maush- Shaeer', is
Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

Sweat of an Animal Who Persistently Eats Najasat

***Issue*** 117: \* The perspiration of a camel which eats najasat, and
the perspiration of every animal which is habituated to eat najasat, is
najis.

***Issue*** 118: \* The perspiration of a person who enters the state of
Janabat by haraam act is Clean (*tahir/pak* ), but on the basis of
recommended precaution, Salat should not be offered with that sweat.
Similarly sexual intercourse with the wife in her menses, knowingly,
will be considered as Janabat by haraam act.

***Issue*** 119: If a person has sexual intercourse with his wife at a
time when it is forbidden, like, in the month of Ramadhan during
fasting, his perspiration will not be classified with the perspiration
of those who become Mujnib by haraam act.

***Issue*** 120: If a person in Janabat by haraam act does tayammum
instead of Ghusl, and perspires after performing tayammum, his
perspiration will be governed by the same rules which applied to his
perspiration before the tayammum.

***Issue*** 121: If a person becomes Mujnib by haraam act, and then
engages in lawful sexual intercourse with his wife, the recommended
precaution for him is that he should not offer prayers with his
perspiration. But if he has lawful sexual intercourse in th e first
instance, and then commits the haraam act, his perspiration will not be
treated as the perspiration of a person who has become Mujnib by haraam
act.

Ways of Proving Najasat
-----------------------

***Issue*** 122: \* There are three ways of proving the najasat of
anything:

One should be certain, or satisfied that something is najis. If one
suspects that something may be najis, it is not necessary to avoid it.
Accordingly, eating or drinking at stalls and guest houses where public
goes to eat, and where people without scruples about najasat frequent,
is allowed unless one knows that the food supplied is najis.

If a reliable person who possesses, controls or manages a thing, says
that it is najis. For example, if the wife, or a servant, or a maid says
that a particular utensil or any other object which she handles, is
najis, it will be accepted as najis.

If two just persons testify that a certain thing is najis, provided that
their testimony deals with the reason for najasat.

***Issue*** 123: If a person does not know whether a thing is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) or najis because of ignorance, for example, if he does
not know whether the droppings of a rat is Clean (*tahir/pak* ) or not,
he should enquire from those who know. But, if he knows the rule, and
doubts the nature of particular thing, like when he doubts whether a
thing is blood or not, or if he does not know whether it is the blood of
a mosquito or a human being, the thing is

Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and it is not necessary to make investigation or
enquiry about it. 124. A thing which was originally najis, and one
doubts whether it has become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), will be considered as
najis. Conversely, if a thing was originally Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and
if one doubts whether it has become najis, it will be considered Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). And it is not necessary t o ascertain, even if it is
possible to do so.

***Issue*** 125: If a person knows that out of the two vessels, or two
dresses used by him, one has become najis, but cannot identify it, he
should refrain from using both of them. But if he does not know whether
it is his own dress, or the dress which is no longer possessed by him,
or is the property of some other person, which has become najis, then it
is not necessary for him to refrain from using his own dress.

How a Clean (tahir/pak) Thing Becomes Najis
-------------------------------------------

***Issue*** 126: \* If a Clean (*tahir/pak* ) thing touches a najis
thing and if either or both of them are so wet that the wetness of one
reaches the other, the Clean (*tahir/pak* ) thing will become najis.
Similarly, if the wetness of the thing which has become najis, touches a
third thing, that t hird thing will also become najis. It is commonly
held by the scholars, that a thing which has become najis transmits its
najasat, but indefinite number of transmissions is improbable. In fact,
after certain stage it is Clean (*tahir/pak* ). For example, if the
right hand of a person becomes najis with urine, and then, while still
wet, it touches his left hand, the left hand will also become najis.
Now, if the left hand after having dried up, touches a wet cloth, that
cloth will also become najis, but, if that cloth touc hes another wet
thing, it cannot be said to be najis. In any case, if the wetness is so
little, that it does not affect the other thing, then the Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) thing will not become najis, even if it had contacted the
Najisul Ayn.

***Issue*** 127: If a Clean (*tahir/pak* ) thing touches a najis thing
and one doubts whether either or both of them were wet or not, the Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) thing does not become najis.

***Issue*** 128: \* If there are two things and one does not know which
of them is Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and which is najis, and later a damp
Clean (*tahir/pak* ) thing touches one of them, that thing does not
become najis.

***Issue*** 129: If the ground, cloth, or similar things are wet, then
only that part will become najis where najasat reaches, and the
remaining part will remain Clean (*tahir/pak* ). Same is the case with
melon, cucumber etc.

***Issue*** 130: When a syrup or ghee is in a fluid state, in a manner
that if some quantity of it is removed, it does not leave an empty
trace, the entire quantity will become najis immediately when even their
slightest part becomes najis. But if it has solidified, and when some
part of it is removed, a trace of emptiness is seen, then only that part
will be najis which has come in contact with najasat, even if the empty
trace gets filled up later. So, if the droppings of a rat fall on it,
only that part will becom e najis on which the droppings have fallen,
and the rest will remain Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 131: If a fly or an insect sits on wet, najis thing, and
later sits on wet, Clean (*tahir/pak* ) thing, the Clean (*tahir/pak* )
thing will become najis, if one is sure that the insect was carrying
najasat with it, and if one is not sure, then it remains Clean
(*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 132: If a part of one's body which is perspiring becomes
najis, all those parts to which the sweat reaches, will become najis.
Where it does not reach will remain Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 133: \* If there is blood in the phlegm, or substance which
comes out of the nose or throat, the part with blood will be najis, and
the remaining part will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ). Hence, if these
substances come out of the mouth, or the nose, the part about which one
is sure that najasat has reached, will be najis, and the part about
which one is doubtful whether najasat has reached it or not, will be
considered Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 134: \* If an ewer or a vessel with a hole in its bottom, is
placed on najis ground, and its water ceases to flow, allowing water to
collect under it, till it is seen as one with the water inside the
vessel, the water in the vessel will be najis. However, if the water
inside the vessel continues to flow forcefully, it will not become
najis.

***Issue*** 135: If a thing enters the body reaching najasat, but has no
trace of it when brought out of the body, it is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).
Hence, if the apparatus of enema, or its water, enters one's rectum, or
a needle or knife, or any other similar thing, is driven into the bo dy
and has no trace of najasat when it is taken out later, it is not najis.
Same is the case with sputum and mucus of the nose, if it contacts blood
within the body, but does not have any trace of blood when it comes out
of the body.

Rules Regarding Najasaat
------------------------

***Issue*** 136: To make the script and pages of holy Qur'an najis, and
violate its sanctity, is undoubtedly haraam, and if it becomes najis, it
should be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) immediately with water. In fact, as
an obligatory precaution, it is haraam to make it najis even if no
violation of sanctity is intended, and it is obligatory that it should
be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by washing it with water.

***Issue*** 137: If the cover of the holy Qur'an becomes najis, causing
its desecration, the cover should be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by
washing it with water.

***Issue*** 138: \* Placing the holy Qur'an on a Najisul Ayn, like,
blood, or a dead body, even if it be dry, is haraam, if the intention is
to profane it.

***Issue*** 139: Writing the holy Qur'an with najis ink, even one letter
of it, amounts to making it najis. And if written, it should be erased
or washed off.

***Issue*** 140: If giving the holy Qur'an to a non-believer involves
its desecration, it is haraam to give it to him, and it is obligatory to
take it back from him.

***Issue*** 141: If a page from the holy Qur'an, or any sacred object
like a paper on which the names of Almighty Allah or the Holy Prophet or
the holy Imams are written, falls in a lavatory, it is obligatory to
take it out and make it Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with water, no matter what
expenses it may entail. And, if it is not possible to take it out, the
use of that lavatory should be discontinued till such time when one is
certain that the page has dissolved and petered out. Similarly, if
Turbatul Husayn (the sacred earth of Karbala, usually formed into a
tablets to place one's forehead on, while offering prayers) falls into
lavatory, and it is not possible to take it out, the lavatory

should not be used until one becomes sure that it (Turbatul Husayn) has
ceased to exist, and no tra ce of it is present there.

***Issue*** 142: It is haraam to eat or drink or make others eat or
drink something which has become najis. However, one may give such a
thing to a child, or an insane person. And if a child or an insane
person eats or drinks najis thing on his own accord, or makes food najis
with his najis hands before consuming it, it is not necessary to stop
him from doing so.

***Issue*** 143: \* To sell or lend a najis thing which can be made
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), has no objection, but the buyer or the borrower
must be told about it, particularly in the following two situations:

That if he is not informed, he might contravene the law of Shariah,
like, if he wants to eat or drink it. Otherwise, it is not necessary to
inform.

That the buyer or the borrower will pay heed to the advice. If one knows
that it will have no effect, it will not be necessary to tell him.

***Issue*** 144: If a person sees someone eat or drink something najis,
or pray with a najis dress, it is not necessary to admonish him.

***Issue*** 145: \* If a place or carpet of a man's house is najis, and
if he sees that the wet body or dress of his visitor will touch the
najis thing, since it is he who is responsible, therefore he should
inform the visitor, provided the two situations mentioned in rule 143
obtain.

***Issue*** 146: \* If the host comes to know during the meals, that the
food is najis, he should inform the guests about it. But if one of the
guests becomes aware of it, it is not necessary for him to inform others
about it. However, if his dealings with the other guests are such, that
he himself may become najis, or be involved in Najasat if they became
najis, he should inform them.

***Issue*** 147: \* If a borrowed object becomes najis, the borrower
must inform the owner, provided the situations mentioned in rule 143 is
observed.

***Issue*** 148: \* If a child says that a thing is najis, or that he
has washed and made it Clean (*tahir/pak* ), his word should not be
accepted. But, if he is about to attain the age of puberty, and assures
that he has washed and made it Clean (*tahir/pak* ), his word should be
accepted if the t hing is normally in his charge, and if he is reliable.

Mutahhiraat
-----------

***Issue*** 149: \* There are twelve things which make najis objects
Clean (*tahir/pak* ):

1. Water

2. Earth

3. The Sun

4. Transformation (Istihala)

5. Change (Inqilab)

6. Transfer (Intiqal)

7. Islam

8. Subjection (Taba'iyat)

9. Removal of original najasat

10. Confining (Istibra) of animal which feeds on najasat

11. Disappearance of a Muslim

12. Draining of the usual quantity of blood from the slaughtered body of
an animal.

### I. Water

###

***Issue*** 150: \* Water makes najis thing Clean (*tahir/pak* ), when
the following four conditions are fulfilled:

1. The water should be pure. Hence a najis thing cannot be made Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) with mixed water like rose-water, or melon-water etc.
(Mudhaaf)

2. The water should be Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

3. The water should not turn into Mudhaaf while the najis thing is being
washed. Furthermore, the smell, colour, or taste of the najasat should
not exist after the final washing, but if changes occur during earlier
washings, there is no harm in it. For example, if a thing is washed with
Kurr-water,or under-Kurr water and, in order to make it Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), it is necessary to wash it twice, it will become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) if the changes in the water do not occur in the second
washing. Any changes occurring in the first washing would not matter.

4. Small particles of Najisul Ayn should not remain behind in a najis
thing after it has been washed. Other conditions for making najis thing
Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by water less than Kurr will be mentioned later.

***Issue*** 151: \* The interior of a najis vessel, or utensil, must be
washed three times if less than Kurr water is used, and as per
obligatory precaution, the same will apply if Kurr or running water is
used. If a dog drinks water or any other liquid from a utens il, the
utensil should be first scrubbed with Clean (*tahir/pak* ) earth, and
after washing off the dust, it should be washed twice with Kurr or
lesser water. Similarly, if the dog licks a utensil, and something
remains in it, it should be scrubbed with dust before washin g. And if
the saliva of a dog falls into the utensil, as per obligatory
precaution, it should be scrubbed with dust and then washed with water
three times.

***Issue*** 152: \* If the mouth of a utensil which a dog has licked, is
narrow, dust should be thrown into it and after adding some quantity of
water, it should be shaken vigorously, so that the dust may reach all
parts of it. Thereafter, the utensil should be wash ed in the manner
mentioned above.

***Issue*** 153: If a utensil is licked by a pig, or if it drinks any
liquid from it, or in which a field-mouse has died, then it should be
washed seven times

with running water, or Kurr or lesser water. It will not be necessary to
scour it with dust.

***Issue*** 154: A utensil which becomes najis because of alcoholic
beverage, should be washed three times, with no difference between Kurr,
lesser, or running water.

***Issue*** 155: If an earthenware has been made of najis clay, or najis
water has penetrated in it, it should be put into Kurr or running water,
so that wherever water reaches, it will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ). And if
it is intended to make its interior Clean (*tahir/pak* ) it should be
left in Kurr or running water for such time, that the water would
penetrate into its entire structure. And if the earthenware is moist,
preventing water from reaching its inner parts, then it should be
allowed to dry up, before it is put in Kurr or running water.

***Issue*** 156: A najis utensil can be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with
under-Kurr water in two ways:

1. The utensil should be filled up with water and emptied three times.

2. Some quantity of water is poured in it, and then the utensil is
vigorously shaken, so that the water reaches all najis parts before it
is spilled. This should be done three times.

***Issue*** 157: If a large pot like a cauldron etc. becomes najis, it
will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ) if it is filled up with water three times,
and emptied every time. Alternatively, if water is poured from above
three times, in such a way that it reaches all its sides, and then the
water which collects at the bottom is drawn out everytime, it will
become Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But as a recommended precaution, the vessel
used for drawing out water should be washed, when being used for the
second and third time.

***Issue*** 158: \* If najis copper and similar things are melted, and
washed with water, their exterior becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 159: \* If a baking oven (Tannur) becomes najis with urine,
and if water is poured into it once from above, in a manner that it
reaches all its sides, the oven will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But as
a recommended precaution, this should be done twice. And if the oven h
as become najis due to something other than urine, then the najasat
should be eliminated first, and thereafter, water will be poured into it
as described. It is better that a pit or hole is dug at the bottom, so
that water collects there. That water is th en drawn out, and the pit is
filled with Clean (*tahir/pak* ) earth.

***Issue*** 160: \* If a najis thing is immersed once in Kurr or running
water, in such a way that water reaches all its najis parts, it becomes
Clean (*tahir/pak* ). And in the case of a carpet or dress, it is not
necessary to squeeze or wring or press it. And when body or dress is
najis because of urine, it must be washed twice even in Kurr water.

***Issue*** 161: \* When a thing which has become najis with urine, is
to be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with water less than Kurr, it should be
poured once, and as water flows off eliminating all the traces of urine,
the thing will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But if dress or body has
become najis be cause of urine, it must be washed twice so that it is
Clean (*tahir/pak* ). When a cloth or a carpet and similar things are
made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with water which is less than Kurr, it must be
wrung, or squeezed, till the water remaining in it runs out.

***Issue*** 162: \* If anything becomes najis with the urine of a
suckling child, who has not yet started taking solid food, and, as a
precaution, is less than two years old, the thing will be Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) if water is poured over it once, reaching all parts which
had been na jis. As a recommended precaution, water should be poured
over it once again. And if it is a carpet or dress etc. it will not be
necessary to squeeze it.

***Issue*** 163: \* If anything becomes najis with najasat other than
urine, it becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by first removing the najasat and
then pouring under Kurr water once, allowing it to flow off. But, if it
is a dress etc., it should be squeezed so that the remaining water s
hould flow off.

***Issue*** 164: \* If it is proposed to make Clean (*tahir/pak* ) a
mat, woven with thread, it should be immersed in Kurr or running water.
When the essential najasat disappears from it, it will be Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). But if one uses under Kurr water for making it Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), then it must be wrung or sq ueezed in whatever way
possible, even by passing it under the feet, till water in it runs off.

***Issue*** 165: \* If the exterior of wheat, rice, soap etc. becomes
najis, it becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by dipping it in Kurr or running
water. But, if their interior becomes najis, they will be Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) if Kurr or running water reaches the internal parts.
However, in the case of a soap and similar objects, water does not reach
the internal parts at all.

***Issue*** 166: \* If one doubts whether najis water has seeped into
the interior of soap or not, its interior will be considered Clean
(*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 167: \* If the outer part of rice, meat, or any other
similar thing becomes najis, it may be placed in a bowl etc., and then
water is poured on it once.Then the bowl is emptied, so that the objects
in it become Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But if the bowl itself is najis, this
process must be repeated three times. At the end, the bowl will also
become Clean (*tahir/pak* ). If one wishes to make a dress or similar
thing Clean (*tahir/pak* ) in a container, one will pour water, and then
press and squeeze the object and tilt the container, so that the
remaining water pours off.

***Issue*** 168: \* If a najis dress, which has been dyed with indigo or
with any similar dye, is dipped into Kurr or running water, it will
become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) if water reaches all its parts before water
becomes mudhaaf with colour. But if it is made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with
less than Kurr water, it will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) only if
mudhaaf water does not come out at the time of wringing or squeezing.

***Issue*** 169: If a dress is washed with Kurr-water or running water,
and later, for example, black mud is found stuck on it, the dress will
be Clean (*tahir/pak* ) if one does not suspect that the black mud has
prevented water from reaching the dress.

***Issue*** 170: \* If slush of mud or soap is seen on dress etc. after
being made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with water, it will be considered Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). However, if najis water has reached the interior of mud
or soap, then the exterior of the slush will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ),
and its interior will be najis.

***Issue*** 171: A najis thing does not become Clean (*tahir/pak* )
unless the Najisul Ayn is removed from it, but there is no harm if the
colour, or smell of the najasat remains in it. So, if blood is removed
from a cloth, and the

cloth is made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with water, it will become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) ev en if the colour of blood remains on it. But if, on
account of the smell or colour, it becomes certain, or seems probable
that some particles of najasat are still present in the cloth etc., it
will remain najis.

***Issue*** 172: \* If najasat of the body is removed in Kurr or running
water, the body will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), except when it is
najis because of urine, for which one washing is not enough. But it is
not necessary to walk in and out of water to achieve two washing. If a
person under water wipes the najis part with hand, allowing water to
reach there again, it will suffice.

***Issue*** 173: \* If najis food remains between the teeth, and water
is taken in the mouth and moved in such a way that it reaches the entire
najis food, the food becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 174: \* If the najis hair of head and face is washed with
under Kurr-water and if it is not overgrown, it is not necessary to
squeeze them for remaining water to flow off.

***Issue*** 175: \* If a part of the najis body, or dress is washed with
under Kurr-water the parts adjacent to it where water usually reaches
will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), when the najis part becomes Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). It means that it is not necessary to wash those sides
independently, as t he najis part and parts around it become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) together. And similar is the case, if a Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) thing is placed by the side of a najis thing, and water
is poured on both of them. Hence, if water is poured on all fingers
while trying to make one najis finger Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and najis as
well as Clean (*tahir/pak* ) water reaches them all, they will all be
Clean (*tahir/pak* ) together.

***Issue*** 176: Meat or fat which becomes najis, can be made Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) with water like all other things. Same is the case if the
body or dress has a little grease on it, which does not prevent water
from reaching it.

***Issue*** 177: If a utensil or one's body is najis, but also so greasy
that water cannot reach it, one should first remove the grease, so that
water may reach one's body, or the utensil before making it Clean
(*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 178: Tap water which is connected with Kurr-water is
considered to be Kurr.

***Issue*** 179: If a person washes a thing with water, and becomes sure
that it has become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), but doubts later whether or not
he had removed the Najisul Ayn from it, he should wash it again, and
ensure that the Najisul Ayn has been removed.

***Issue*** 180: If the ground which absorbs water (e.g. land on the
surface of which there is fine sand) becomes najis, it can be made Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) with under-Kurr water.

***Issue*** 181: \* If the floor which is made of stones, or bricks or
other hard ground, in which water is not absorbed, becomes najis, it can
be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with under-Kurr water, but, it is necessary
that so much water is poured on it that it begins to flow. And if that
water is not drained out, and it collects there, it should be drawn out
by a vessel or soaked by a cloth.

***Issue*** 182: If the exterior of salt-stone or something resembling
it, becomes najis, it can be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with under-Kurr
water.

***Issue*** 183: If najis sugar, or syrup is turned into solid cubes, or
granules, it will not become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) if it is immersed in
Kurr or running water.

### II. Earth

###

***Issue*** 184: \* The earth makes the sole of one's feet and shoes
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), provided that the following four conditions are
fulfilled:

1. The earth should be Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

2. The earth should be dry, as a precaution.

3. As an obligatory precaution, the najasat should have stuck from the
earth.

4. If Najisul Ayn, like blood or urine, or something which has become
najis, like najis clay, is stuck on the sole of a foot, or a shoe, it
will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ) only if it is cleared by walking on earth,
or by rubbing the foot of the shoe against it. Therefore, i f the
Najisul Ayn vanishes by itself, and not by walking or rubbing on the
ground, the foot or the sole will not be Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by earth,
as an obligatory precaution. And the earth should be dust or sand, or
consisting of stones or laid with bricks; which means w alking on
carpet, mats, green grass will not make the sole of feet or shoes Clean
(*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 185: Walking over a tar road, or a wooden floor, will not
make the najis sole of feet and shoes Clean (*tahir/pak* ). It is a
matter of Ishkal.

***Issue*** 186: In order to make the sole of one's feet or shoe Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), it is better that one should walk a distance of at least
fifteen arm-lengths or more, even if the najasat disappears by walking a
lesser distance, or by rubbing one's foot on earth.

***Issue*** 187: It is not necessary that the najis sole of one's feet
or shoe are wet. They become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by walking on earth,
even if they are dry.

***Issue*** 188: When the najis sole of one's foot or shoe becomes Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) by walking on earth, the parts adjacent to it, which are
usually blotched with mud, become Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 189: If a person moves on his hands and knees, and his hands
or knees become najis, it is improbable that they become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) by such movement. Similarly, the end of a stick, the
bottom of an artificial leg, the shoe of quadruped and the wheels of a
car or a cart etc. would not be Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 190: If after walking, the smell or colour of the najasat,
or its invisible particles, remain in the sole of the feet or the shoe,
there is no harm in it, although the recommended precaution is that one
should walk so much, that these things also disappe ar.

***Issue*** 191: \* The inner part of the shoe does not become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) by walking, and similarly, the under part of the socks
will not become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), unless it is made of skin or
something similar, and one walks with it.

### III. The Sun

###

***Issue*** 192: \* The sun makes the earth, building, and the walls
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), provided the following five conditions are
fulfilled:

1. The najis thing should be sufficiently wet, and if it is dry, it
should be made wet so that the sun dries it up.

2. If the Najisul Ayn is present on that thing, it should be removed
from it before it is dried by the sun.

3. Nothing should intervene between the najis thing and the sun.
Therefore, if the rays fall on the najis thing from behind a curtain
etc, or a cloud, and makes it dry, the thing will not become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). But, there is no harm if the cloud is so thin that it
does not serve as an impediment, between the najis thing and the sun.

4. Only the sun should make the najis thing dry. So, if a najis thing is
jointly dried by the wind and the sun, it will not become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). However, it would not matter if the wind blows lightly,
and it may not be said that it has had any share in making the najis
thing dry.

5. The sun should dry up the whole najis part of the building all at
once. If the sun dries the surface of the najis earth, or building,
first, and later on dries the inner part, only the surface will become
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and the inner portion will remain najis.

***Issue*** 193: \* A najis mat will be made Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by the
sun, but if it is woven with threads, then the threads becoming Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) is a matter of Ishkal. Similarly, the sun does not, in
all probabilities, make Clean (*tahir/pak* ) the trees, the grass, the
doors and the windows.

***Issue*** 194: If the sun shines on najis earth, and one doubts later
whether the earth was wet or not at that time, or whether the wetness
dried up because of the sunshine or not, the earth will remain najis.
Similarly, if one doubts whether Najisul Ayn had been removed from the
earth before sunshine, or whether there was any impediment preventing
direct sunshine, the earth will remain najis.

***Issue*** 195: If the sun shines on one side of a najis wall and as a
consequence of it, the other side of the wall also dries up, then both
the sides will be considered Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

### IV. Transformation (Istihala)

###

***Issue*** 196: If a najis thing undergoes such a change, that it
assumes the category of a Clean (*tahir/pak* ) thing it becomes Clean
(*tahir/pak* ); for example, if a najis wood burns and is reduced to
ashes, or a dog falls in a salt-marsh and transforms into salt, it
becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But a thing do es not become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) if its essence or category does not change; like, if
wheat is ground into flour, or is used for baking bread, it does not
become Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 197: \* Any earthenware which is made of najis clay, is
najis. But coal derived from najis wood will be Clean (*tahir/pak* ), if
it has no semblance of its origin.

***Issue*** 198: A najis thing about which it is not known whether it
has undergone any transformation (Istihala) or not, remains najis.

### V. Change (Inqilab)

###

***Issue*** 199: Any liquor which becomes vinegar by itself, or by
mixing it with vinegar or salt, becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 200: \* Wine which is prepared from najis grapes etc., or if
any external najasat reaches it, would not become Clean (*tahir/pak* ),
if it turns into vinegar.

***Issue*** 201: Vinegar which is prepared from najis grapes, raisins
and dates is najis.

***Issue*** 202: If tiny stems and stalks from grapes or dates are
added, and then vinegar is poured over it, or, if cucumber and brinjal
is added before it turns into vinegar, there will be no harm, except if
it becomes an intoxicant, before becoming vinegar.

***Issue*** 203: \* If the juice of grapes ferments by itself, or when
heated, it becomes haraam. However, if it boils so much that only 1/3
part of it is left, it becomes halal. And it has already been mentioned
in rule 114 that the juice of grapes does not become najis on
fermentation.

***Issue*** 204: \* If 2/3 of the grape juice gets reduced without
fermentation, and the remainder ferments, and if it is commonly held as
grape juice and not as syrup, it will be haraam, as an obligatory
precaution.

***Issue*** 205: The juice of grapes, about which it is not known
whether fermentation has taken place or not, is halal. But if it
ferments, then it will not be halal till 2/3 of it is gone.

***Issue*** 206: If, for example, there are some ripe grapes in a bunch
of unripe grapes, and the juice of that bunch is not commonly known as
“grape juice”, it will be halal even if it ferments.

***Issue*** 207: If one grape falls in something which is boiling with
heat, and if it ferments, but does not get dissolved in it, eating that
grape alone will be haraam.

***Issue*** 208: If juice of grapes is being cooked in several pots, it
is permissible to use the same spoon for the pot which has boiled, and
the one which has not.

***Issue*** 209: A thing, about which one does not know whether it is
unripe grapes or ripe grapes, will be halal if it ferments.

### VI. Transfer (Intiqal)

###

***Issue*** 210: \* If the blood of a human being, or of an animal whose
blood gushes forth when its large vein is cut, is sucked by an insect,
normally known to be bloodless, and it becomes part of its body, the
blood becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ). This process is called Intiqal.

But when a blood-sucking leech sucks human blood during some treatment,
it will be najis, because it is not considered as part of its body – it
is considered as human blood.

***Issue*** 211: If one kills a mosquito which has sat on one's body,
and blood which it has sucked comes out, it will be considered Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), as it was destined to be its part, even if the time gap
between its sucking and it being killed be very small. However, as a rec
ommended precaution, one should avoid such blood.

### VII. Islam

###

***Issue*** 212: If an unbeliever testifies Oneness of Allah, and the
Prophethood of Prophet Muhammad, in whatever language, he becomes a
Muslim. And just as he was najis before, he becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* )
after

becoming a Muslim, and his body, along with the saliva and the sw eat,
is Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But if he has any Najisul Ayn in his body, it
should be removed, and then washed. In fact, that part should be washed
even if the najisul ayn had been removed earlier, as per obligatory
precaution.

***Issue*** 213: \* If before an unbeliever becomes a Muslim, his wet
dress touched his body, as an obligatory precaution, it should be
avoided, regardless of whether it is on his body or not.

***Issue*** 214: If an unbeliever professes Islam, he will be Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) even if another person is not sure whether he has
embraced Islam sincerely, or not. And the same order applies even if it
is known that he has not sincerely accepted Islam, but his words or
deeds do not betray anything which may be contrary to the confirmation
by him of the Oneness of Allah, and of Prophet Muhammad being Prophet of
Allah.

### VIII. Subjection (Taba'iyat)

###

***Issue*** 215: Taba'iyat means that a najis thing become Clean
(*tahir/pak* ), in subjection of another thing becoming Clean
(*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 216: When wine is transformed into vinegar, its container,
up to the level wine reached on account of fermentation, will become
Clean (*tahir/pak* ). But, if the back part of the container became
najis because of contact with wine, it should be avoided, even after
wine h as transformed into vinegar.

***Issue*** 217: \* The child of an unbeliever becomes Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) by Taba'iyat, in two cases:

1. If an unbeliever embraces Islam, his child in subjection to him
becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ). Similarly, if the mother, paternal
grandfather, or paternal grandmother of a child embraces Islam, the
child will become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), provided that it is in their
custody and care.

2. If the child of an unbeliever is captured by Muslims, and his
father, paternal grandfather or maternal grandfather is not with him, he
becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ). In both the cases, the child becomes Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) by subjection, on the condition that if it has attained
the ag e of understanding and discerning, it does not show inclination
to Kufr.

***Issue*** 218: The plank or slab of stone on which a dead body is
given Ghusl, and the cloth with which his private parts are covered, and
the hands of the person who gives Ghusl and all things washed, together
with the dead body, become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) when Ghusl is over.

***Issue*** 219: When a person washes something with water to make it
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), his hands washed along with that thing, will be
Clean (*tahir/pak* ) when the thing is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 220: \* If cloth etc. is washed with under-Kurr water and is
squeezed as usual, allowing water to flow off, the water which still
remains in it is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 221: \* When a najis utensil is washed with under-Kurr
water, the small quantity of water left in it after spilling the water
of final wash, is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

### IX. Removal of Najisul Ayn

###

***Issue*** 222: \* If body of an animal is stained with an Najisul Ayn
like blood or with something which has become najis, for example, najis
water, its body becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) when the najasat
disappears. Similarly, the inner parts of the human body, for example
inne r parts of mouth, or nose or inner ears become Clean (*tahir/pak*
), after the najasat has disappeared. But the internal najasat, like the
blood from the gums or the teeth, does not make inner mouth najis.
Similarly, any external thing which is placed internally in the bo dy,
does not become najis when it meets with the internal najasat. So if the
dentures come in contact with blood from other teeth, it does not
require rinsing. Of course, if it contacts najis food, it must be made
Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with water.

***Issue*** 223: \* If food remains between the teeth, and blood emerges
within the mouth, the food will not be najis if it comes in contact with
that blood.

***Issue*** 224: \* Those parts of the lips and the eyes which overlap
when shut, will be considered as inner parts of the body, and they need
not be washed when external najasat reaches them. But a part of which
one is not sure whether it is internal or external, m ust be washed with
water if it meets with external najasat.

***Issue*** 225: If najis dust settles on a cloth or carpet, but is
shaken off and thereafter, something wet touches that cloth etc. that
thing will not become najis.

### X. Istibra of an Animal which Eats Najasat

###

***Issue*** 226: \* The dung and urine of an animal which is habituated
to eating human excrement, is najis, and it could be made Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) by subjecting it to “Istibra”, that is, it should be
prevented from eating najasat, and Clean (*tahir/pak* ) food should be
given to it, till such ti me that it may no more be considered an animal
which eats najasat.

As a recommended precaution, the following animals should be prevented
from eating najasat for the period specified:

• Camel for 40 days

• Cow for 20 days

• Goat/Sheep for 10 days

• Water-fowl for 7 or 5 days

• Domestic hen for 3 days

The period specified should be completed, even if the animals cease to
be considered as eaters of najasat earlier than that.

### XI. Disappearance of a Muslim

###

***Issue*** 227: \* When body, dress, household utensil, carpet or any
similar thing which has been in the possession of a Muslim becomes
najis, and thereafter that Muslim disappears, the things in question can
be treated as Clean (*tahir/pak* ), if one believes that he may have was
hed them. But the recommended precaution is that he should not take them
as Clean (*tahir/pak* ), except with the following conditions:

• That Muslim should be believing in the najasat of an object which
made his body or dress najis. For example, if his dress with its wetness
touches a Kafir, and he does not believe a Kafir to be najis, his dress
will not be deemed Clean (*tahir/pak* ) after his disap pearance.

• That Muslim should know that his body or dress has touched a najis
thing.

• That the man should have been seen using that thing for a purpose
which requires it being Clean (*tahir/pak* ). For example, he should
have been seen offering prayers with that dress.

• There should be an expectation that the Muslim knows that the
condition for the act he wants to perform is to be Clean (*tahir/pak* ).
For example, if he does not know that the dress of one who offers
prayers should be Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and he offers prayers with a
najis dress, that dress cannot be considered to be Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

• The Muslim should be conscious of the difference between najis and
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and that he should not be careless about it. If he
is careless, his things will not be considered Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 228: \* If a person is certain or satisfied that a thing
which was najis has become Clean (*tahir/pak* ), or if two just persons
testify showing why it is Clean (*tahir/pak* ), then that thing is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ). And similarly, when a person who possesses the najis
thing, reliably says that it has b ecome Clean (*tahir/pak* ), or when a
Muslim has washed the najis thing with water, even if it may not be
known whether or not he has washed it properly, the thing will be
considered Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 229: If a person undertakes to wash and make Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) the dress of another person and confirms having washed
it, and if the other person is satisfied with what he is told, the dress
is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 230: \* If a person is in such a mental state that he can
never be certain about a najis thing becoming Clean (*tahir/pak* ), he
should follow the method used by the common people.

### XII. Flowing out of Blood of a Slaughtered Animal in Normal Quantity

###

***Issue*** 231: As stated in rule 98, if an animal is slaughtered in
accordance with the rules prescribed by Islam, and blood flows out of
its body in normal quantity, the blood which still remains in the body
of the animal is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 232: \* The above rule is applicable only to an animal whose
meat is halal to eat, and does not apply to an animal whose meat is
haraam. In fact, as a recommended precaution, it does not apply to the
haraam parts of the body of an animal, whose meat is halal to eat.

### Rules About Utensils

###

***Issue*** 233: If a utensil is made of the hide of a dog, or a pig or
the dead animal (not slaughtered lawfully), it is haraam to eat or drink
anything from that utensil, if its najasat is caused by wetness. Also,
that utensil should not be used for Wudhu and Ghus l, and for other
purposes for which only Clean (*tahir/pak* ) things should be used. And
the recommended precaution is that the skin of a dog, or pig or a dead
animal, should not at all be used, even if it is not in the form of a
utensil.

***Issue*** 234: It is haraam to use gold and silver vessels for eating
and drinking purposes, and as an obligatory precaution, their general
use is also haraam. However, it is not haraam to have them in possession
as item of decoration, although it is better to av oid them as a
precautionary measure.

Similarly, it is not haraam to manufacture gold and silver vessels, or
to buy and sell them for possession or decoration, but it is better to
avoid.

***Issue*** 235: \* If the clip of a tea-glass (istakaan) made of gold
or silver is classified as a utensil, it will be equivalent to a
tea-glass made of gold or silver (and it will be haraam to use it for
drinking purposes). And if it (the clip) is not classified as utensil,
there is no harm in using it.

***Issue*** 236: \* There is no harm in using vessels which are
gold-plated or silver-plated.

***Issue*** 237: There is no harm in using a utensil which is made of
alloy mixed with gold and silver, if the proportion of alloy is such
that the utensil cannot be said to be made of gold or silver.

***Issue*** 238: \* If a person transfers food from the utensil made of
gold or silver into another utensil, he can eat in or from it, provided
that the later utensil is not considered as part of the package.

***Issue*** 239: There is no harm using the tip of the pipe used in
Huqqa, or the scabbard of a sword, or knife, or the frame of the Holy
Qur'an made of gold or silver. However, the recommended precaution is
that the receptacles of perfume, or surma, or opium made o f gold or
silver should not be used.

***Issue*** 240: There is no harm in eating or drinking from gold and
silver utensils, if one is helpless and has no alternative, but he
should not eat or drink to his fill.

***Issue*** 241: There is no harm in using a utensil, about which it is
not known whether it is made of gold or silver, or something else.

Wudhu
-----

***Issue*** 242: In Wudhu, it is obligatory to wash the face and hands,
and to wipe the front portion of the head and the upper part of two
feet.

***Issue*** 243: \* The length of the face should be washed from the
upper part of the forehead, where hair grow, up to the farthest end of
the chin, and its breadth should be washed to the part covered between
the thumb and the middle finger. If even a small part of this area is
left out, Wudhu will be void. Thus, in order to ensure that the
prescribed part has been fully washed, one should also wash a bit of the
adjacent parts.

***Issue*** 244: If the hands or the face of a person are larger or
smaller than normal, he should observe how people normally wash their
faces, and follow accordingly. Also, if he has hair on part of his
forehead, or the frontal part of his head is bald, he should wash his
forehead as is usually washed by the people.

***Issue*** 245: If a person suspects that there is dirt or something
else in the eyebrows, and corners of his eyes, and on his lips, which
does not permit water to reach them, and if that suspicion is
reasonable, he should examine it before performing Wudhu, and re move
any such thing if it is there.

***Issue*** 246: If the skin of the face is visible from under the hair,
one should make the water reach the skin, but if it is not visible, it
is sufficient to wash the hair, and it is not necessary to make the
water reach beneath the hair.

***Issue*** 247: If a person doubts whether his skin is visible from
under the hair of the face or not, he should, as an obligatory
precaution, wash his hair, and also make the water reach the skin.

***Issue*** 248: \* While performing Wudhu, it is not obligatory that
one should wash the inner parts of the nose, nor of the lips and eyes
which cannot be seen when they close. However, in order to ensure that
all parts have been washed, it is obligatory that some portion of these
parts (i.e. inner parts of nose, lips and eyes) are also included. And
if a person did not know how much of the face should be washed, and does
not remember whether he has washed his face thoroughly in Wudhu already
performed, his prayer s will be valid, and there will be no need to do
fresh Wudhu for the ensuing prayers.

***Issue*** 249: \* The face and hands should be washed from above
downwards, and if one washes the opposite way, his Wudhu will be void.

***Issue*** 250: \* If a person makes his hand wet, and passes it over
his face and hands, and if the moisture in the hand is enough to cover
both thoroughly, it will be sufficient. It is not necessary that water
flows on the face or the hands.

***Issue*** 251: \* After washing the face, one should first wash the
right hand and then the left hand, from the elbows to the tips of the
fingers.

***Issue*** 252: \* In order to ensure that each elbow has been washed
thoroughly, one should include some portion above the elbow in washing.

***Issue*** 253: If before washing his face, a person has washed his
hands up to the wrist, he should, while performing Wudhu, wash them up
to the tips of the fingers, and if he washes them only up to the wrist,
his Wudhu is void.

***Issue*** 254: \* While performing Wudhu, it is obligatory to wash the
face and the hands once, and it is recommended to wash them twice.
Washing them three or more times is haraam. As regards to which washing
should be treated as the first, it will depend upon wa shing the face
and hand thoroughly, leaving no room for precaution, with the niyyat of
Wudhu. So, if he pours water on his face ten times with the intention of
the first washing, there is no harm, but when he will then wash with the
niyyat of Wudhu, it wi ll be called the first time. Thus, he can go on
pouring water on his face several times, and in the final wash, make the
niyyat of Wudhu. But if he follows this procedure, then the face and the
hands should be washed once only, as an obligatory precaution.

***Issue*** 255: After washing both the hands, one performing Wudhu
should wipe the front part of his head with the wetness which is in his
hand; the recommended precaution is that he should wipe it with the palm
of his right hand, from the upper part, downwards.

***Issue*** 256: The part on which wiping should be performed, is one
fourth frontal part of the head. It is sufficient to wipe as much at any
place in this part of the head, although the recommended precaution is
that the length should be equal to one finger, and i ts breadth should
be equal to three joined fingers.

***Issue*** 257: It is not necessary that the wiping of the head should
be performed on its skin. It is also in order if a man wipes the hair on
the front of his head. However, if the hair are so long that when combed
they fall on his face, or on other parts of his head, he should wipe his
hand on the roots of his hair, or part the hair and wipe the skin. If a
person collects his hair on the front side of his head, or on other
parts of his head and wipes them, or if he wipes the hair of other
places, such a wiping w ould be void.

***Issue*** 258: \* After wiping the head, one should wipe with the
moisture present in one's hands, one's feet from any toe of the foot up
to the joint. As a recommended precaution, the right foot should be
wiped with the right hand, and the left foot with the left hand.

***Issue*** 259: Wiping of the feet can have any breadth, but it is
better that the breadth of the wiping should be equal to three joined
fingers, and it is still better that the wiping of the entire foot is
done with the entire hand.

***Issue*** 260: \* As a precaution, at the time of wiping the foot, one
should place one's hand on the toes and then draw it to the joint, or
that one should place the hand on the joint and draw it to the toes. One
should not simply place the whole hand on the foot, and pull it a
little.

***Issue*** 261: \* While wiping one's hand and feet, it is necessary to
move one's hand on them, and if the feet and head are moved leaving the
hand stationary, Wudhu would be void. However, there is no harm if the
head and feet move slightly, while the hand is be ing moved for wiping.

***Issue*** 262: \* The parts of wiping should be dry, and if they are
so wet that the wetness of the palm of the hand has no effect on them,
the wiping will be void. However, there is no harm if the wetness on
those part is so insignificant, that the moisture of th e palm overcomes
it.

***Issue*** 263: If wetness disappears in the palm, it cannot be made
wet with fresh water. In that situation, the person performing Wudhu
should obtain

moisture from his beard. If he obtains moisture from any part other than
the beard, it would be improper, and is a matter of*Ishkal* .

***Issue*** 264: \* If the wetness of palm is just enough for wiping the
head, then as an obligatory precaution, one should wipe the head first,
and for the wiping of feet, the wetness should be obtained from the
beard.

***Issue*** 265: \* Wiping performed on socks or shoes is void. But if
one is unable to remove his socks or shoes because of severe cold, or
fear of life, or a robber, the obligatory precaution is that he will
wipe on the socks or shoes, and then perform tayammum al so. And if a
person is under Taqayya (hiding one's faith), he can perform wiping on
his socks and shoes.

***Issue*** 266: If the upper part of his feet is najis, and it cannot
also be washed for wiping, one should perform tayammum.

### Wudhu By Immersion (Wudhu Irtimasi)

###

***Issue*** 267: \* Wudhu by immersion means that one should dip one's
face and hands into water, with the intention of performing Wudhu. And
there can be no problem in performing wiping with the moisture thus
acquired, though it is against precaution.

***Issue*** 268: Even while performing Wudhu by immersion, one should
wash one's face and hand downwards from above. Hence, when a person dips
his face and hands in water, with the intention of Wudhu, he should dip
his face in water from the forehead and his hands f rom elbows.

***Issue*** 269: There is no harm in performing Wudhu of some parts by
immersion, and of others in the usual way.

### Recommended Supplications

###

***Issue*** 270: It has been recommended that a person performing*Wudhu*
should recite the following supplication when his eyes fall on
water:*Bismillahi wa billahi wal hamdu lil lahil lazi ja'alal ma'a
tahura wa lam yaj alhu najisa* . (I begin my ablution in the Name of
Allah. All praise is due to Allah, Who made water purifying, and not
najis).

While washing the hands before performing Wudhu, one should say:*Alla
hummaj alni minat tawwabina waj alni minal mutatah hirin* . (O Lord!
Make me of those who repent and purify themselves).

While rinsing the mouth one should say:*Alla Humma laq qini hujjati
yawma alqaka wa atliq lisani bizikrika.* (O Lord! Dictate to me the
principles of faith on the Day I meet You, and make my tongue fluent
with Your remembrance).

While washing the nose one should say:*Alla humma la tuharrim 'alaya
rihal jannati waj 'alni mim man yashummu riha ha wa rawha ha wa tiba ha*
. (O Lord! Do not deprive me of the fragrance of Paradise, and make me
of those who smell its fragrance and perfume).

While washing the face, one should say:*Alla humma bayyiz wajhi yawma
taswaddufihil wujuh wala tusawwid waj hi yawma tabyazzul wujuh.* (O
Lord! Make my face bright on the Day when the faces will turn dark. Do
not darken my face on the Day when the faces are bright).

While pouring water over the right elbow, one should say*: Alla humma
a'tini kitabi bi yamini wal khulda fil jinani bi yasari wa hasibni
hisaban*

*yasira* . (O Lord! Give my book of deeds in my right hand, and a
permanent stay in Paradise on my left, and m ake my reckoning an easy
one).

While pouring water over the left elbow, one should say:*Alla humma la
tutini kitabi bishimali wala min wara'i zahri wala taj alha maghlu latan
ila unuqi wa a'uzu bika min muqat ta'atin niran.* (O Lord! Do not give
my book of deeds in my left hand, n or from behind my back, nor chain it
to my neck. I seek refuge in You from the Hell-fire).

While performing the wiping of the head, one should say:*Alla humma
ghashshini bi rahmatika wa barakatika wa 'afwika.* (O Lord! Cover me
with Your Mercy, Blessings and Forgiveness).

While performing the wiping of the feet, one should say:*Alla humma
thabbitni alas sirati yawma tazillu fihil aqdam. Waj'al sa'yi fi ma
yurzika 'anni ya zal jalali wal ikram.* (O Lord! Keep me firm on the
Bridge (to Paradise) on the Day when the feet will slip, and help me in
my efforts to do things which will please You, O' Glorious and Mighty!).

### Condition for the Validity of Wudhu

###

Following are the conditions for a correct Wudhu:

• The first condition is that the water should be Clean (*tahir/pak* ),
and clean, not sullied with dirt, even if that dirt is Clean
(*tahir/pak* ).

• The second condition is that the water should be pure, and not mixed.

***Issue*** 271: Wudhu performed with najis or mixed water is void,even
if one may not be aware of its being najis, or mixed, or may have
forgotten about it. And if one has offered prayers with that Wudhu, one
should repeat that prayers with a valid Wudhu.

***Issue*** 272: \* If a person does not have any water to perform
Wudhu, except that which is murky with clay, he should perform tayammum
if only a short time is left for prayers; and if he has enough time at
his disposal, he should wait till the water becomes lim pid, and then
perform Wudhu with it.

• The third condition is that the water should be Mubah (permissible for
use).

***Issue*** 273: \* To perform Wudhu with usurped water, or with water
about which one does not know whether the owner would allow its use, is
haraam, and Wudhu will be void. Furthermore, if the water of Wudhu used
for washing face and hands, falls on usurped land, or if the space in
which he performs Wudhu is usurped, his obligation will be to do
tayammum, if he has no other place to go for Wudhu. And if another
lawful place is available, he should go there for Wudhu. And if he does
Wudhu at the first place, his Wu dhu will be valid, but he will have
committed a sin.

***Issue*** 274: \* If a person does not know whether the pool or tank
of water of a madressah has been dedicated to the general public, or
exclusively to the students of madressah, there is no harm in doing
Wudhu there, provided that people usually do so at that pl ace without
prohibition.

***Issue*** 275: \* If a person who does not wish to offer prayers in a
particular mosque, is not aware whether its pool has been dedicated to
the general public, or specifically to those who offer prayers in that
mosque, he cannot perform Wudhu with the water of th e pool of that
mosque. However, if people who do not pray in that mosque, usually
perform Wudhu there, without any prohibition, he can perform Wudhu from
that pool.

***Issue*** 276: \* Performing Wudhu from the pools of the inns and
hotels etc. by persons who are not residing there, is valid if the other
persons who are not staying there usually perform Wudhu with that water,
without being prohibited.

***Issue*** 277: \* There is no harm if a person performs Wudhu in the
water flowing in big canals, even if he does not know whether the owner
of that canal would allow. But, if the owner of the canal prohibits
performing Wudhu with that water, or if he is a minor, or an insane
person, then as a recommended precaution, one should refrain from doing
Wudhu in it.

***Issue*** 278: \* If a person forgets that the water has been usurped,
and performs Wudhu with it, his Wudhu is in order. But, if a person has
usurped the water himself, and then forgets about it, his Wudhu with
that water will be void.

• The fourth condition is that the container of the water, used by the
person concerned for Wudhu, should be Mubah (permissible for use by
him).

• The fifth condition is that, as an obligatory precaution, the
container of the water used for Wudhu should not be made of gold or
silver. The details of these two rules will follow later.

***Issue*** 279: \* If the water for Wudhu is in a usurped container or
is in the vessels of gold and silver, and there is no other water
available, he should transfer that water lawfully into another
container, and then do Wudhu. If he cannot possibly do that, he s hould
perform tayammum. However, if he has other water, he should use that for
Wudhu. And in either case, if he acts against the rule and performs
Wudhu with the water which is either in a usurped container, or is made
of gold or silver, his wudhu will be in order.

***Issue*** 280: A pool of water which has a usurped stone or brick in
it, can be used for Wudhu, if drawing water from it would not in any way
amount to using that brick or stone. If it amounts to that, then drawing
water will be haraam, but Wudhu will be valid.

***Issue*** 281: If a pool or a canal is dug in the courtyards of the
Shrines of Imams, or their descendents, which was previously a
grave-yard, there is no harm in performing Wudhu with water of that pool
or canal, if he did not know that land was previously dedica ted as a
graveyard.

• The sixth condition is that parts of the body on which Wudhu is
performed, should be Clean (*tahir/pak* ), at the time of washing and
wiping.

***Issue*** 282: If the place which has been already washed or wiped in
Wudhu becomes najis, before the completion of the Wudhu, it will be
deemed valid.

***Issue*** 283: If any other part of the body other than the parts of
Wudhu is najis, the Wudhu will be in order. However, if the outlet of
urine or excretion have not been made Clean (*tahir/pak* ), the
recommended precaution is that one should make them Clean (*tahir/pak* )
first, and then perfor m Wudhu.

***Issue*** 284: \* If any one part of Wudhu was najis, and after
performing Wudhu one doubts whether he washed it before Wudhu or not,
his Wudhu will be valid. But he should wash the part which was najis.

***Issue*** 285: If a person has a cut or wound on his face, or hands,
and the blood from it does not stop, and if water is not harmful for
him, he should, after washing the healthy parts of that limb in proper
sequence, put the place of wound or cut in Kurr-water o r running water,
and press it a little so that the blood may stop. Then he should pass
his finger on the wound or cut, within the water, from above downwards,
so that water may flow on it. This way his Wudhu will be in order.

• The seventh condition is that the person doing Wudhu should have
sufficient time at his disposal for Wudhu and Salat.

***Issue*** 286: If the time is so short that by doing Wudhu, the entire
prayers or a part of it will have to be offered after its time, he
should perform tayammum. But if he feels that the time required for
tayammum and Wudhu is equal, then he should do Wudhu.

***Issue*** 287: \* If a person who should have performed tayammum owing
to little time for Salat at his disposal, performs Wudhu with the niyyat
of Qurbat, or for any*Mustahab* act, like, reading the holy Qur'an, his
Wudhu is in order. Similarly, his Wudhu will be v alid if he did it for
that Salat, as long as it was not devoid of niyyat of Qurbat.

• The eighth condition is that one should perform Wudhu with the niyyat
of Qurbat i.e. to obey the orders of Allah. If, a person performs Wudhu,
for the purpose of cooling himself or for some other purpose, the Wudhu
would be void.

***Issue*** 288: It is not necessary that one should utter the niyyat of
Wudhu in words, or think about it in his mind. It is sufficient that all
the acts relating to Wudhu are performed in compliance with the order of
Almighty Allah.

• The ninth condition is that Wudhu should be performed in the
prescribed sequence, that is, he should first wash his face, then his
right hand and then his left hand, and thereafter, he should wipe his
head and then the feet. As a recommended precaut ion, he should not wipe
both the feet together. He should wipe the right foot first and then the
left.

• The tenth condition is that the acts of Wudhu should be done one after
the other, without time gap in between.

***Issue*** 289: \* If there is so much gap between the acts of Wudhu,
that it can not be said that it is being performed in normal succession,
Wudhu will be void. But if there is a justifiable excuse, like water
being exhausted or forgetting, at the time of washing or wiping, he
should first ensure that all the preceding parts which he had washed or
wiped have not dried up. If they have all dried up, his Wudhu will be
void. But if all the parts have not dried up, then his Wudhu will be in
order. For example, while washing his left arm, he finds that his right
arm has dried up, but his face is still wet, his Wudhu will be valid.

***Issue*** 290: If a person performs acts of Wudhu consecutively, but
the moisture of the previous parts dries up owing to hot weather, or
excessive heat of the body or any other similar cause, his Wudhu is in
order.

***Issue*** 291: \* There is no harm in walking while performing Wudhu.
Hence, if after washing his face and hands, a person walks a few steps
and then wipes his head and feet, his Wudhu is valid.

• The eleventh condition is that a person doing Wudhu should wash his
hands and face and wipe his head and feet himself. Hence, if another
person makes him perform Wudhu, or helps him in pouring water over his
face, or hands, or in wiping his head, or feet, his Wudhu is void.

***Issue*** 292: \* If a person cannot perform Wudhu himself, he should
appoint someone to assist him, even if it means washing and wiping
jointly. And if that person demands any payment for that, he should be
paid, provided one can afford, and one does not sustain a ny loss. But
he should make niyyat of Wudhu himself, and should wipe using his own
hands. If the person himself cannot participate in actually doing Wudhu,
and if he must be assisted by another person, then an obligatory
precaution is that both should mak e the niyyat of Wudhu. Then his
assistant will hold his hand, and help him do the wiping. And if that is
not possible, he will take some moisture from his hands, and with that
moisture wipe his hand and feet.

***Issue*** 293: \* One should not obtain assistance in performing those
acts of Wudhu, which one can perform alone.

• \* The twelfth condition is that there should be no constraint for
using water.

***Issue*** 294: If a person fears that he will fall ill if he performs
Wudhu, or, if water is used up for Wudhu, no water will be left for
drinking, he does not have to do Wudhu. If he was unaware that water was
harmful to him, and he performed Wudhu, and later on, it turned out to
be harmful, his Wudhu will be void.

***Issue*** 295: If one finds that using minimum quantity for washing
the face and the hands properly, will not be harmful, he should do Wudhu
by restricting himself to that quantity of water.

• The thirteenth condition is that there should be no impediment in the
way of water reaching the parts of Wudhu.

***Issue*** 296: \* If a person finds that something has stuck to any
part of Wudhu, but doubts whether it will prevent water from reaching
there, he should remove that thing, or pour water under it.

***Issue*** 297: \* Dirt under the fingernails would not affect Wudhu.
However, when the nails are cut, and there remains dirt which prevents
water from reaching the skin, then that dirt must be removed. Moreover,
if the nails are unusually long, the dirt collected beneath the unusual
part, ought to be cleansed.

***Issue*** 298: If swelling takes place on the face, or hands, or the
front part of the head, or the feet because of being burns or other
reason, it will be sufficient to wash and wipe over the swelling. If
there is an opening or hole in it, it will not be necessar y to reach
water under the skin. In fact, if a part of its skin gets peeled off, it
is not at all necessary to pour water under the unpeeled part. However,
at times there is skin which hangs loose after having peeled off, it
should be cut off, or water sh ould be poured underneath.

***Issue*** 299: If a person doubts whether something has remained stuck
to the parts of Wudhu, and if it is a doubt which is deemed sensible by
the people, like, a potter doubting whether clay is stuck to his hands
after his

work, he should examine and clean his ha nds by scrubbing etc, till he
is sure that there are no remnants, and that water will reach there.

***Issue*** 300: If there is dirt on the part of Wudhu which will not
prevent water reaching the body while washing or wiping, the Wudhu will
be in order. Similarly, if some white lime splashed from the whitewash
stays on the body, not obstructing water from reachin g it, Wudhu will
be valid. And if one doubts whether it may obstruct, then one should
remove the splashed particles.

***Issue*** 301: \* If a person was aware before performing Wudhu, that
on some parts of Wudhu, there is something which could prevent water
from reaching them, but if he doubts after performing Wudhu whether
water reached those parts or not, his Wudhu will be valid.

***Issue*** 302: \* If on some part of Wudhu, there is an obstruction
which at times allows water to reach the skin and at times does not, and
if he doubts after having performed Wudhu about water having reached the
skin, as a recommended precaution, he should repeat the Wudhu,
particularly if he had not been mindful about ensuring that water
reaches.

***Issue*** 303: \* If after Wudhu a person finds something on the parts
of Wudhu which prevents water from reaching the skin, not knowing
whether it was present at the time of Wudhu, or it appeared later, his
Wudhu would be in order. But if he knows that at the ti me of Wudhu he
was not bothered about that obstruction, then the recommended precaution
is that he should repeat Wudhu.

***Issue*** 304: \* If a person doubts after Wudhu whether any
obstruction was there or not, his Wudhu will be valid.

Rules Regarding Wudhu

***Issue*** 305: If a person doubts too often about the acts of Wudhu
and its conditions, like, about water being Clean (*tahir/pak* ), or its
not being usurped, he should not pay any heed to such doubt.

***Issue*** 306: If a person doubts whether his Wudhu has become void,
he should treat it as valid. But, if he did not perform Istibra (rule
no. 73) after urinating, and performed Wudhu, and thereafter some fluid
was discharged about which he was not sure whether it was urine or
something else, his Wudhu will be void.

***Issue*** 307: If a person doubts whether he has performed Wudhu or
not, he should perform Wudhu.

***Issue*** 308: \* If a person is sure that he has performed Wudhu, and
has also committed an act which invalidates Wudhu (e.g. urinating), but
does not remember which happened first, he should act as follows:

• If this situation arises before his Salat, he should perform Wudhu.

• If it arises during Salat, he should break it and perform Wudhu.

• If it arises after Salat, that Salat will be valid, but for the next
prayers, however, he should perform Wudhu.

***Issue*** 309: If after or during Wudhu, a person becomes sure that he
has not washed certain parts or has not wiped them, and if the moisture
of the parts preceding them has dried up due to lapse of time, he should
perform Wudhu again. And if the moisture has not dried up, or has dried
up owing to hot weather, or other similar causes, he should wash or wipe
the forgotten

part as well as the parts which follow. Similarly, if during Wudhu he
doubts whether he has washed or wiped a part or not, he should follow
the same rule as above.

***Issue*** 310: \* If a person doubts after Salat, whether he performed
Wudhu or not, the prayers offered by him would be in order. As far the
next prayers, he should perform Wudhu.

***Issue*** 311: If a person doubts during Salat whether he has
performed Wudhu, his prayers is void, and he should perform Wudhu and
then pray.

***Issue*** 312: If a person realises after offering prayers, that his
Wudhu became void, but doubts whether it became void before Salat or
after, the prayers offered by him will be deemed in order.

***Issue*** 313: If a person suffers from an incontinence, due to which
drops of urine come out continuously, or he is not in a position to
control his bowels, he should act as follows:

• If he is sure that at some time during the prayer time, there will be
a respite during which there will be a restraint, then he should perform
Wudhu and Salat at such time.

• If during the restraint, he can control his urine or excretion only
for performing*Wajib* acts of Salat, then he should perform only
obligatory acts, and abandon the*Mustahab* acts (e.g. Adhan, Iqamah,
Qunut etc).

***Issue*** 314: \* If the time of restraint is just enough to allow
Wudhu and a part of Salat, and if he discharges urine or excretion once,
or several times during Salat, then as an obligatory precaution, he
should do Wudhu in those moments of respite and pray. It will not be
necessary for him to renew the Wudhu during Salat because of discharging
urine or excretion, though as a recommended precaution, he should keep a
container by his side, make Wudhu everytime he discharges, and continue
praying. But this last p recaution would not apply, if due to prolonged
discharge or renewal of Wudhu, the mode of prayers changes.

***Issue*** 315: \* If there is a continued incontinence, allowing no
period of restraint for Wudhu, or even a part of Salat, then one Wudhu
for every Salat will undoubtedly be enough. In fact, one Wudhu will be
enough for several Salat, except when one commits any extraneous act,
invalidating the Wudhu. However, it is recommended that he should do a
fresh Wudhu for every Salat. But a fresh Wudhu is not necessary for the
Qadha of a forgotten Sajdah, or Tashahhud, nor for the prayers
of*Ihtiyat* .

***Issue*** 316: It is not necessary for a person suffering from
continued incontinence, to pray immediately after Wudhu, although it is
better that he should be quick in offering prayers.

***Issue*** 317: It is permissible for a person suffering incontinence
to touch the script of the Qur'an, after Wudhu, even if he is not in the
state of Salat.

***Issue*** 318: A person who cannot control urine, should use a bag
filled with cotton or some similar device, to protect oneself, and to
prevent urine from reaching other places, and the obligatory precaution
is that before every Salat, he should wash the outlet o f urine which
has become najis. Moreover, a person who cannot control excretion
should, if possible, prevent it from reaching other parts, at least
during the time required for

Salat. And the obligatory precaution is that if no hardship is involved,
he sh ould wash the anus for every prayers.

***Issue*** 319: A person who suffers from incontinence should, if
possible, try to restrain himself at least for the duration of Salat,
even if may be difficult. In fact, if his ailment can be treated easily,
he should get the necessary treatment.

***Issue*** 320: \* If a person who suffered incontinence, recovers from
the ailment, it is not necessary for him to repeat those prayers which
he offered according to his religious duty, during the period of his
ailment. However, if he recovers during Salat, he sho uld repeat that
prayers, as an obligatory precaution.

***Issue*** 321: If a person suffers from an incontinence, which renders
him unable to control passing the wind, he will act according to the
rules applicable to the incontinent persons described in the foregoing.

### Things for which Wudhu is Obligatory

###

***Issue*** 322: \* It is obligatory to perform Wudhu for the following
six things:

• For all obligatory prayers, except Salat al-Mayyit. As
regards*Mustahab* prayers, Wudhu is a condition for their validity.

• For the Sajdah and Tashahhud which a person forgot to perform during
the prayers, provided that he invalidated his Wudhu after Salat, and
before performing those forgotten acts. It is not obligatory to perform
Wudhu for Sajdatus sahw.

• For the obligatory Tawaf of the holy Ka'bah.

• If a person has made a Nadhr, or a solemn pledge, or taken an oath for
Wudhu.

• If a person has made a Nadhr, for example, that he would kiss the Holy
Qur'an.

• For washing and making Clean (*tahir/pak* ) the holy Qur'an which has
become najis, or for taking it out from lavatory etc. in which it has
fallen, when he becomes obliged to touch the script of the holy Qur'an
with his hand, or some other part of his body. But if t he delay by
making Wudhu causes further desecration of the holy Qur'an, one should
take it out from lavatory etc., or make it Clean (*tahir/pak* ), without
performing Wudhu.

***Issue*** 323: It is haraam to touch the script of the holy Qur'an
with any part of one's body, without performing Wudhu. However, there is
no harm in touching the translation of the holy Qur'an, in any language,
without Wudhu.

***Issue*** 324: It is not obligatory to prevent a child or an insane
person from touching the script of the holy Qur'an. However, if their
touching the holy Qur'an violates its sanctity, they should be prevented
from touching it.

***Issue*** 325: It is haraam, as an obligatory precaution, to touch the
Name of Allah or His special Attributes without Wudhu, in whichever
language they may have been written. And it is also better not to touch,
without Wudhu, the names of the holy Prophet of Isla m, the holy Imams
and Janabe Fatima Zahra (peace be upon them).

***Issue*** 326: If a person performs Wudhu or Ghusl before the time for
prayers, in order to be in state of purity, they will be deemed valid.
And

even if he performs Wudhu near the time of Salat, with the niyyat of
preparing himself for Salat, there is no objectio n.

***Issue*** 327: If a person believes that the time for prayers has set
in, and makes the niyyat of*Wajib* Wudhu, and then realises after
performing the Wudhu that the time for the prayers had not set in, his
Wudhu is in order.

***Issue*** 328: \* Wudhu is*Mustahab* for the following purposes:

• Salat al-Mayyit.

• Visiting the graves.

• Entering a mosque.

• Entering the Shrines of the holy Prophets and Imams (A.S.).

• For reading, writing, or touching the margin or border of the holy
Qur'an, or for keeping it with oneself.

• Before going to bed for sleep. It is also*Mustahab* that a person
already in Wudhu, should perform a fresh Wudhu for every Salat.

If he has performed Wudhu for any one of the above purposes, he can
commit all acts which require Wudhu. For example, he can even pray with
that Wudhu.

### Things which Invalidate Wudhu

###

***Issue*** 329: Wudhu becomes void on account of the following seven
things:

• Passing of urine.

• Excretion.

• Passing wind from the rear.

• A sleep, deep enough to restrict sight and hearing. However, if the
eyes do not see anything, but the ears can hear, Wudhu does not become
void.

• Things on account of which a person loses his sensibility, like
insanity, intoxication or unconsciousness.

• Istihaza – which will be dealt with later.

• Janabat, and, as a recommended precaution, every state which requires
Ghusl.

### Jabira Wudhu

###

The splint with which a wound or a fractured bone is bandaged or held
tight and the medication applied to a wound etc. is called jabira.

***Issue*** 330: If there is a wound, or sore, or a fractured bone in
the parts on which Wudhu is performed, and if it is not bandaged, then
one should perform Wudhu in the usual manner, if the use of water is not
harmful.

***Issue*** 331: If there is an unbandaged wound, sore, or broken bone
in one's face or hands, and if the use of water is harmful for it, one
should wash the parts adjoining the wound from above downwards, in the
usual manner of Wudhu. And it is better to pass wet h and on it, if it
is not harmful to do so. Therefore, he should place a Clean (*tahir/pak*
) piece of cloth on it, and pass a wet hand over that cloth. But in the
case of a fracture, tayammum must be performed.

***Issue*** 332: \* If there is an unbandaged wound, or sore or
fractured bone on the front part of the head, or on the feet, and he
cannot wipe it, because the wound has covered the entire part of wiping,
or if he cannot wipe even the healthy parts, then it is nece ssary for
him to do tayammum. And as a

recommended precaution, he should also perform Wudhu, keeping a piece of
Clean (*tahir/pak* ) cloth on the wound etc. and wipe that cloth with
the moisture of Wudhu in his hands.

***Issue*** 333: \* If the sore, or wound, or fractured bone is
bandaged, and if it is possible to undo it, and if water is not harmful
for it, one should untie it and then do Wudhu, regardless of whether the
wound etc. is on his face and hands, or on the front part of his head or
on his feet.

***Issue*** 334: If the wound, or sore, or the fractured bone which has
been tied with a splint or a bandage is on the face or the hands of a
person, and if undoing it and pouring water on it is harmful, he should
wash the adjacent parts which is possible to wash, a nd then wipe the
Jabira.

***Issue*** 335: If it is not possible to untie the bandage of the
wound, but the wound and the bandage on it are Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and
if it is possible to make water reach the wound without any harm, water
should be made to reach the wound by pouring from above downward. And i
f the wound or its bandage is najis, but it is possible to wash it, and
to make water reach the wound, then he should wash it and should make
water reach the wound at the time of Wudhu. And if water is not harmful
for the wound, but it is not possible to make water reach it, or the
wound is najis and cannot be washed, he should perform tayammum.

***Issue*** 336: \* If the jabira covers some of the parts of Wudhu,
then Wudhu prescribed for Jabira is enough. But if all the parts of
Wudhu are totally covered in Jabira, then, as a precaution, one should
do tayammum, and also do Wudhu as per rules of Jabira.

***Issue*** 337: It is not necessary that jabira should be made of
things which are permissible in Salat. For example, if it is of silk, or
even of the parts of an animal whose meat is haraam to eat, it is
permissible to perform wiping on it.

***Issue*** 338: If a person has jabira on his palm and fingers, and he
passes a wet hand on it while performing Wudhu, he can do the wiping of
his head and feet with the same wetness.

***Issue*** 339: If the jabira has covered the entire surface of the
foot, but a part from the side of the fingers, and a part from the upper
side of the foot is open, one should do wiping on the foot at the open
places, and also on the surface of the jabira.

***Issue*** 340: If a person has several jabiras on his face or hands,
he should wash the places between them, and if the jabiras are on the
head or on the feet, he should wipe the places between them. And as for
the places where there are jabiras, he should act acc ordingly to the
rules of jabira.

***Issue*** 341: \* If the jabira has covered unusually more space than
the size of the wound, and it is difficult to remove it, then one should
perform tayammum, except when the jabira is at the places of tayammum
itself, in which case, it is necessary that he shou ld perform both
Wudhu and tayammum. And in both the cases, if it is possible to remove
the jabira he should remove it. Then, if the wound is on the face and
hands, he should wash its sides, and if they are on the head or the
feet, he should wipe its corne rs. As for the wounds themselves, he will
act according to the rules of jabira.

***Issue*** 342: If there is no wound or fractured bone in the parts of
Wudhu, but the use of water is harmful for some other reason, one should
perform tayammum.

***Issue*** 343: \* If a person has got his vein opened on any one of
the parts of Wudhu, and he cannot wash it, he must perform tayammum. But
if water is harmful for it, then he should act as rules of jabira.

***Issue*** 344: \* If something is stuck on the part of Wudhu or Ghusl,
and it is not possible to remove it, or its removal involves unbearable
pain, then one should perform tayammum. But, if the thing which is stuck
is a medicine, then rules relating to jabira wi ll apply to it.

***Issue*** 345: \* In all kinds of Ghusls, except the Ghusl of Mayyit,
the jabira Ghusl is like jabira Wudhu. However, in such cases one should
resort to Ghusl al-tartibi.

If there is a wound, or a sore on the body, then a person has a choice
between Ghusl and tayammum. If he decides to do Ghusl, and if there is
no jabira on the place, the recommended precaution is that he should
place a Clean (*tahir/pak* ) piece of cloth on the unbandage d wound, or
sore, and wipe over that cloth. However, if there is fractured bone in
the body, he should do Ghusl and should, as a precautionary measure,
also perform wiping on the jabira. And if it is not possible to wipe on
the jabira, or if the fractured bone is not in splint, it is necessary
for him to perform tayammum.

***Issue*** 346: If the obligation of a person is to do tayammum, and if
at some of the places of tayammum he has wound, sore, or fractured bone,
he should perform jabira tayammum according to the rules of jabira
Wudhu.

***Issue*** 347: \* If a person who has to pray with jabira wudhu or
jabira Ghusl, knows that his excuse will not be removed till the end of
time for Salat, he can offer prayers in the prime time. But if he hopes
that his excuse will be removed before the end of nam az time, it is
better for him to wait, and if his excuse is not removed by then, he
should offer prayers with jabira Wudhu or jabira Ghusl. And if, however,
he prayed in the prime time, and his excuse was removed before the end
of Salat time, the recommen ded precaution is he should do Wudhu or
Ghusl, and repeat the prayers.

***Issue*** 348: If a person has to keep his eye lashes stuck together
because of some eye disease, he should perform tayammum.

***Issue*** 349: If a person cannot decide whether he should perform
tayammum or jabira Wudhu, the obligatory precaution is that he should
perform both.

***Issue*** 350: \* The prayers offered with jabira Wudhu are valid, and
that Wudhu can be valid for later prayers also.

Ghusl: Obligatory Baths
-----------------------

There are seven obligatory baths:

• Bath for Janabat

• Bath for Hayz (for women only)

• Bath for Nifas (for women only)

• Bath for Istihaza (for women only)

• Bath for touching a dead body

• Bath for a dead body

• Bath which becomes obligatory on account of a vow or an oath to
perform it.

Rules Regarding Janabat
-----------------------

***Issue*** 351: \* A person enters the state of Janabat in two ways:

• Sexual intercourse

• Discharge of semen, while sleeping or when awake, little or more, with
lust or otherwise, voluntarily or involuntarily.

***Issue*** 352: When one cannot ascertain whether the fluid emitted
from one's body is semen, urine or something else, it will be treated as
semen if it is thrown out with lust and if the body is slackened. If all
or some of these signs are not present the fluid will not be treated as
semen. In the case of illness, the fluid may not come out with sudden
swiftness and the body may not slacken; but if the emission takes place
with lust, it will be treated as semen.

***Issue*** 353: If a fluid emitted by a healthy person possesses one of
the aforesaid three signs and he does not know whether or not it also
possessed other signs, and if before the emission he was with wudhu he
will content himself with that wudhu. And if he was not with wudhu, it
would be sufficient for him to perform wudhu only, and Ghusl would not
be necessary.

***Issue*** 354: It is*Mustahab* that a person should urinate after the
seminal discharge. If he did not urinate and an emission was seen after
Ghusl, which could not been determined as semen or something else, it
would be treated as semen.

***Issue*** 355: If a person has sexual intercourse with a woman and the
male organ enters either of the private parts of the woman up to the
point of circumcision or more, both of them enter Janabat, regardless of
whether they are adults or minors and whether ejaculation takes place or
not.

***Issue*** 356: If a person doubts whether or not his penis penetrated
up to the point of circumcision, Ghusl will not become obligatory on
him.

***Issue*** 357: If (God forbid!) a person has sexual intercourse with
an animal and ejaculates, Ghusl alone will be sufficient for him, and if
he does not ejaculate and he was with wudhu at the time of committing
the unnatural act even then Ghusl will be sufficient for him. However,
if he was not with wudhu at that time, the obligatory precaution is that
he should do Ghusl and also perform wudhu. And the same orders apply if
one commits sodomy.

***Issue*** 358: If movement of seminal fluid is felt but not emitted,
or if a person doubts whether or not semen has been ejaculated, Ghusl
will not be obligatory upon him.

***Issue*** 359: A person who is unable to do Ghusl, but can perform
tayammum is allowed to have sexual intercourse with his wife even after
the time for daily prayers has set in.

***Issue*** 360: If a person observes semen on his dress and knows that
it is his own, and he has not done Ghusl on that account, he should do
Ghusl, and repeat as Qadha all those prayers about which he is certain
that he offered them after the discharge of semen. However, it is not
necessary for him to repeat those prayers about which there is a
probability that he might have offered them before the discharge of
semen.

Forbidden Acts for those in Janabat
-----------------------------------

***Issue*** 361: \* The following five things are Haraam for junub:

• To touch with any part of one's body the script of the holy Qur'an or
the Name of Almighty Allah in whichever language it may be. And it is
better that the names of the holy Prophet and Imams and Hazrat Fatima
Zahra (peace be upon them) should also not be touched in that condition.

• Entering Masjidul Haraam or Masjidun Nabi, even though it may be only
passing from one gate and going out of another.

• To stay or halt in all other Masjids, and similarly, on the basis of
obligatory precaution, to stay in the shrines of the holy Imams.
However, there is no harm if one crosses or traverses through a mosque,
entering from one gate and exiting from another.

• To enter a mosque with an intention of lifting away something or
placing something in it.

• To recite those verses of the holy Qur'an on the recitation of which
performance of Sajdah becomes obligatory. These verses occur in four
surahs of the holy Qur'an:

• Surah Alif Lam Mim as-Sajdah, 32:15

• Surah Ha Mim Sajdah, 41:38

• Surah an-Najm, 53:62

• Surah al 'Alaq, 96:19

Things which are Makrooh for Junub
----------------------------------

***Issue*** 362: \* The following nine things are Makrooh for junub:

• To eat

• To drink

• But if the junub washes his or her face, hands and mouth, then eating
or drinking in that state will not be Makrooh. And if he or she washes
the hands only, then unworthiness of the acts is reduced.

• To recite more than seven verses of the holy Qur'an other than those
in which obligatory Sajdah occur.

• To touch the cover, the margin or border of the holy Qur'an or the
space between its lines, with any part of one's body.

• To keep the holy Qur'an with oneself.

• To sleep. But its would not be Makrooh to sleep if the person
concerned performs wudhu or performs tayammum instead of Ghusl on
account of non-availability of water.

• To dye one's hair with henna etc

• To apply oil on one's body.

• To have sexual intercourse after Ihtelam (i.e. discharge of semen
during sleep).

Ghusl for Janabat
-----------------

***Issue*** 363: \* Ghusl for Janabat is obligatory for offering the
daily prayers and other similar acts of worship. However, it is not
obligatory for Salat al-Mayyit or for sajdatus sahv (prostrating on
account of oversight) or sajdatush shukr' (prostration for thanksgiving)
or for the obligatory Sajdah upon reciting the four particular verses of
the holy Qur'an. (Rule no. 361)

***Issue*** 364: \* At the time of doing ghusl, it is not necessary to
have in mind that one is performing an obligatory Ghusl. It is
sufficient if one performs the Ghusl with the intention of Qurbat, i.e.
complying with Allah's orders.

***Issue*** 365: If a person who performs Ghusl with the niyyat
of*Wajib* after having ascertained that the time of Salat had set in,
comes to know after performing the bath that it was performed before the
time for prayers had set in, the bath would be correct and valid.

***Issue*** 366: \* There are two methods of performing Ghusls,
both*Wajib* and*Mustahab* .

• Tartibi (Sequential)

• Irtimasi (By submerging the whole body).

### Tartibi

###

***Issue*** 367: \* In this method, a person should first make a niyyat
for Ghusl. Thereafter one should first wash one's head and neck, and
thereafter the remaining parts of one's body. It is better that one
washes the right part of the body first and then the left part.

And if a person, while standing under the water, jerks each of these
parts on one's body with an intention of performing Tartibi Ghusl, it
will not be sufficient and the precaution is that one should not content
oneself with it.

And if a person washes the body before washing the head, either
intentionally, or on account of forgetfulness or because of not knowing
the rule, Ghusl is void.

***Issue*** 368: \* If a person washed the body before the head it will
not be necessary to repeat the bath. What one has to do is to wash the
body again and Ghusl will then be correct.

***Issue*** 369: In order to ensure that both the parts (head, neck and
remaining parts of the body) have been washed thoroughly one should,
while washing a part, also include some portion of the other part with
it.

***Issue*** 370: After the Ghusl, if a person realises that certain
parts of the body have been left out, not knowing which, it will not be
necessary to wash the head again. One will wash only those parts of
one's body which one feels had not been washed.

***Issue*** 371: If one realises after Ghusl that one has not washed a
certain part of the body it is sufficient to wash only that part if it
is the left side. However, if that part is the right side then the
recommended precaution is that after washing that part of the body one
should wash the left side again. And if the unwashed part is that of
head and neck one should, after washing that part, wash the body once
again.

***Issue*** 372: \* If a person doubts before completing Ghusl whether
one has washed a part on the left or right side it will be necessary to
wash that part and if one doubts about having washed a part of the head
and neck then, as an obligatory precaution, one would wash that part and
then wash the right and the left side of the body again.

### Irtimasi

###

***Issue*** 373: \* Ghusl by way of Irtimasi is either carried out
instantly or gradually. If the Ghusl of Irtimasi is to be done at one
instance, then water must reach all parts of the body at one time.
However, it is not necessary that the whole body be submerged in water
from the very beginning of Ghusl. If a part of the body is outside, and
is later submerged with the niyyat of Ghusl, it will be deemed in order.

***Issue*** 374: If one wishes to perform Irtimasi Ghusl gradually, then
it is necessary that the whole body is out of water before Ghusl
commences. Then one would submerge one's body gradually in water with
the intention of Ghusl.

***Issue*** 375: If after performing Ghusl Irtimasi it becomes known
that water has not reached some part of the body one should repeat the
Ghusl, whether the part up to which water has not reached is determined
or not.

***Issue*** 376: If one does not have sufficient time for Tartibi, one
should perform Ghusl by way of Irtimasi.

***Issue*** 377: \* A person who has put on Ihram for Hajj and Umrah is
not allowed to perform Ghusl by way of Irtimasi. However, if one
performs it forgetfully the Ghusl will be valid.

### Rules About Ghusl

###

***Issue*** 378: It is not necessary that the entire body of a person
should be Clean (*tahir/pak* ) before Irtimasi and Tartibi Ghusl. So, if
the body becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) while diving in water or pouring
water over one's body with the intention of the Ghusl, the Ghusl will be
in order.

***Issue*** 379: If a person who entered the state of Janabat due to an
unlawful act takes a bath with warm water, the Ghusl will be valid even
though one may perspire at that time. But the recommended precaution is
that such a person should do Ghusl with cold water.

***Issue*** 380: While doing Ghusl, if a part of the body, however
small, remains unwashed the Ghusl is invalid. But, it is not obligatory
to wash the inside of the ear or nose and other places which are
reckoned to be the interior of the body.

***Issue*** 381: \* If a person doubts whether a particular part of the
body is to be treated as external or internal, it should be washed.

***Issue*** 382: If the hole pierced for an earring and other similar
objects is so wide that it is reckoned to be external, then it should be
washed; otherwise it is not necessary to wash it.

***Issue*** 383: All things which prevent water from reaching the body
should be removed. If a person does Ghusl before ensuring that such
obstacles have been removed, the Ghusl will be void.

***Issue*** 384: At the time of Ghusl, if one doubts whether there is
something on one's body which would prevent water from reaching the
body, one should investigate and satisfy oneself that the obstacle is
not there.

***Issue*** 385: While doing Ghusl, one should wash the short hair which
are taken as a part of the body. Washing of the long hair is not
obligatory. However, if one makes water reach the skin in such a way
that those long hair do not become wet, the Ghusl is in order. However,
if it is not possible to make water reach the skin without washing those
hair one should wash them so that water may reach the body.

***Issue*** 386: All the conditions for the validity of Wudhu (e.g. the
water being pure and not having been usurped) also apply to the validity
of Ghusl. However, for Ghusl it is not necessary that the body be washed
downwards from the head. Moreover, it is not necessary in Tartibi Ghusl
to wash the body immediately after washing the head and the neck. There
is no harm, therefore, if there is a lapse of sometime after washing
one's head and neck before washing one's body. It is not necessary that
one should wash one's head, neck and body in one instance. However, if a
person is incontinent, unable to retain urine or faeces except for such
time that he could be able to offer prayers after Ghusl then he should
do Ghusl at once and offer his prayers immediately thereafter.

***Issue*** 387: If a person uses a public bath with an intention of
deferring payment to its owner, without a prior consent of the owner,
the Ghusl will be void even if the owner is later made to agree to the
arrangement.

***Issue*** 388: If the owner of the public bath is agreeable to the
Ghusl being done on credit basis, but the person doing Ghusl intends not
to pay the charges to him or to pay him from the money acquired
illegally, the Ghusl will be void.

***Issue*** 389: If a person pays to the owner of the public bath from
the funds whose Khums (1/5 of the yearly profit see rule no. 1760) has
not been paid, then such a person commits a sinful act, but the Ghusl
will be valid, though the liability for khums remains.

***Issue*** 390: If a person hires a public bath for Ghusl, but before
commencing Ghusl, he or she carries out an extra function of making the
anal part Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with the same water of the public bath,
and if it becomes doubtful whether the owner would agree to the Ghusl
being taken, then the owner's consent must be sought before the Ghusl.
Otherwise, the Ghusl will be void.

***Issue*** 391: \* When a person is in doubt whether he or she has done
Ghusl or not, such a person must do Ghusl. However, if doubt arises in
the mind after Ghusl as to whether Ghusl was correct or not, then there
is no need to do Ghusl again.

***Issue*** 392: \* If one urinates or passes wind (or does any act
which would invalidate the Wudhu) while doing the Ghusl, one does not
have to abandon the Ghusl and start all over again. In fact, one can
continue with the same Ghusl till completion. However, in this
situation, one will have to do Wudhu also, as per obligatory precaution.

***Issue*** 393: \* A person who has very little time at his disposal
before Qadha, should perform Tayammum instead of Ghusl. Yet, if such a
person

does Ghusl under the impression that there is sufficient time for Ghusl
and offering prayers, the Ghusl will be valid, provided that it was done
with the intention of complying with the orders of Allah, even if the
Ghusl was done with a view to offering the prayers.

***Issue*** 394: \* If a person after being Junub doubts whether or not
he or she did Ghusl, the prayers already offered during that period
would be deemed valid. But for the later prayers, such a person should
do the Ghusl. If any such act which would invalidate Wudhu is committed,
like urinating or passing the wind, after the prayers, then it will be
necessary to do Wudhu, and as an obligatory precaution, to repeat the
prayers he had offered, if time permits.

***Issue*** 395: A person who has more than one Ghusl to do can do one
Ghusl with the niyyat of the rest. In fact, one Ghusl with its niyyat is
enough to represent all others.

***Issue*** 396: If a verse of the holy Qur'an or Name of the Almighty
Allah is written or tattooed on the body of a person then such a person
while doing Wudhu or Ghusl, will be required to pour water on that part
without touching the writing.

***Issue*** 397: A person who does Ghusl of Janabat should not do Wudhu
for the prayers. In fact one can offer prayers without performing Wudhu
after all*Wajib* Ghusls (except the bath for medium istihaza) as well as
after*Mustahab* Ghusls (see rule no. 651). In the case of*Mustahab*
Ghusls, however, it is better to do Wudhu as a recommended precaution.

Kinds of Blood Seen by Women
----------------------------

### Istihaza

###

One type of blood which is seen by women is called istihaza and a woman
in that state is called mustahaza.

***Issue*** 398: Istihaza is usually yellowish and cold and is emitted
without gush or irritation and is also not thick. It is, however,
possible that at times the colour of the blood may be red or dark, and
it may also be warm and thick and may be issued with gush and
irritation.

***Issue*** 399: There are three kinds of istihaza viz. slight (Qalila),
medium (Mutawaassita) and excessive (Kathira). Explanation is given
below:

#### I. Little Blood (Qalila)

####

If the blood remains on the surface of the wool or pad etc., (placed by
a woman on her private part) but does not penetrate into it, the
istihaza is called qalila.

#### II. Medium Blood (Mutawassita)

####

If the blood penetrates into the cotton (or pad etc.), even partially,
but does not soak the cloth tied on the outer side, the istihaza is
called mutawassita.

#### III. Excessive Blood (Kathira)

####

If the blood penetrates through the cotton, soaking it and the cloth
(etc.) around it, the istihaza is called kathira.

### Rules of Istihaza

###

***Issue*** 400: \* In the case of little istihaza the a woman should
perform separate Wudhu for every prayer and should, as a recommended
precaution, wash or change the pad. And if some blood is found on the
outer part of her private parts she should make it Clean (*tahir/pak* )
with water.

***Issue*** 401: \* In the case of Mutawassita, it is an obligatory
precaution for a woman to make one Ghusl every day for her daily
prayers, and she should act accordingly to the rules of little Istihaza
as explained in the foregoing rule. If the state of Istihaza began
before or just at the time of Fajr prayers, she should do Ghusl before
offering Fajr prayers. If she does not do Ghusl intentionally or
forgetfully, she should do Ghusl before Zuhr and Asr prayers. And if she
misses even that, then she should do Ghusl before praying Maghrib and
Isha. This she would do regardless of whether bleeding continues or
stops.

***Issue*** 402: \* In the case of excessive bleeding the woman should
change, as an obligatory precaution, the cotton or pad tied to her
private parts or make it Clean (*tahir/pak* ) with water. It is also
necessary that she should do one Ghusl for Fajr prayers, one for Zuhr
and Asr prayers and once again for Maghrib and Isha prayers. She should
offer Asr prayers immediately after Zuhr prayers and if she allowed any
lapse of time between them, she should do Ghusl again for Asr prayers.
Similarly if she keeps any time gap between Maghrib and Isha prayers,
she should do Ghusl again for Isha prayers.

All these rules apply when bleeding is so excessive that it continues
soiling the pad etc. But if it takes longer to soil the cotton or pad,
and a woman has enough time to pray one or more Salat in between, then,
as per obligatory precaution, she would change the pad or wash it to
make Clean (*tahir/pak* ) and then do Ghusl only when the cloth covering
the pad or cotton is fully soaked.

For example, if a woman praying Salat of Zuhr finds out that the cloth
is fully soaked again before the prayers of Asr, she would do Ghusl for
Asr prayers.

And if she finds that the flow of blood is slow enough to allow two or
more prayers to be offered before the cotton or cloth is totally soiled
with blood, there will be no need for Ghusl before the ensuing prayer.
For example, if she finds that there is enough time to offer even
Maghrib and Isha prayers, before the cloth is fully soaked, she would
pray Maghrib and Isha without Ghusl.

In every case, the Ghusl in excessive Istihaza does not require Wudhu
after it.

***Issue*** 403: If istihaza blood is seen before the time for prayers
has set in, and the woman has not performed Wudhu or Ghusl for that
bleeding, she should perform Wudhu or Ghusl at the time of prayers, even
though she may not be mustahaza at that time.

***Issue*** 404: \* A woman whose Istihaza is medium should first do
Ghusl and then Wudhu, as per obligatory precaution. But if a woman with
excessive Istihaza wishes to do Wudhu, she should do so before the
Ghusl.

***Issue*** 405: When a woman who had little Istihaza finds out after
Fajr prayers that her Istihaza has developed into medium one, she will
have to do Ghusl for Zuhr and Asr prayers. And if that change occurs
after Zuhr, Asr prayers, then she will do a Ghusl for Maghrib and Isha
prayers.

***Issue*** 406: \* If a woman finds out after Fajr prayers that her
little or medium Istihaza had developed into an excessive one, and
remained in that state, then she should follow the directives given in
rule no. 402 in respect of Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha prayers.

***Issue*** 407: \* As explained in rule 402, a woman in excessive
Istihaza must ensure that there is no time gap between Ghusl and the
prayers. Therefore, if such a gap occurs because of doing Ghusl earlier,
then that Ghusl will be void, and the woman will have to do Ghusl again.
This rule applies to those also who are in medium Istihaza.

***Issue*** 408: \* Apart from the rules pertaining to the daily prayers
which have been explained earlier, a woman in little and medium Istihaza
must do Wudhu for all other prayers,*Wajib* or*Mustahab* . But if she
desires to repeat, as a precautionary measure, the daily prayers which
she has already offered or if she wishes to offer once again with
congregation the prayers which she had offered individually, she should
perform all the acts which have been mentioned with regard to Istihaza.
In the case of Salat of*Ihtiyat* , “forgotten sajdahs”, “forgotten
tashahud” which are performed immediately after the prayers it is not
necessary for her to follow the rules of Istihaza. Similarly, no rules
of Istihaza will apply for performing Sajda al-Sahv at any time.

***Issue*** 409: After the bleeding of a mustahaza woman has stopped,
she should follow the rules of istihaza only for the first subsequent
prayers which she may offer. For further prayers which follow, the rules
of Istihaza would not be necessary.

***Issue*** 410: \* If a woman does not know what kind of Istihaza she
has, she should insert into herself some cotton and wait a while to
ascertain. And when she knows which kind of Istihaza it is she would
follow the rules prescribed. And, if she is sure that the type of
Istihaza will not change by the time she stands for her prayers she may
carry out the test before the time for prayers sets in.

***Issue*** 411: If a mustahaza woman starts her prayers without making
any investigation, but her intention is to obey the orders of Allah and
act according to her duty then her prayers are valid. For example, if
her Istihaza was little, and she acted according to its rules, her
prayers will be correct and valid. But if she did not have the intention
of obeying Allah or following the rules, her prayers would be invalid.
For example, she followed the rules of little Istihaza while in actual
fact she was in the medium one, her prayers would be invalid.

***Issue*** 412: If a mustahaza woman cannot discern about her Istihaza
she should act according to the minimum certitude. For example, if she
does not know whether her Istihaza is little or medium she should follow
the rules which are prescribed for little Istihaza. And if she does not
know whether her Istihaza is medium or excessive she should perform the
rules prescribed for the medium Istihaza. But, if she knows which of the
three kinds of Istihaza she has had previously, then she should act
according to the rules for that kind of Istihaza.

***Issue*** 413: If at the time of its initial appearance the blood of
istihaza remains within the interior of the body and does not come out,
it does not nullify the Wudhu and Ghusl already performed by the woman.
And if it comes out, it nullifies the Wudhu and Ghusl even if its
quantity be very small.

***Issue*** 414: \* If a mustahaza woman examines herself after Salat
and finds no blood, she can say other prayers with the same Wudhu, even
if she knows that the blood would reappear.

***Issue*** 415: \* If a mustahaza woman knows that since the time she
has engaged herself with Wudhu or Ghusl blood has not come out of her
body, she can defer offering prayers for as long as she knows she will
remain in that pure state.

***Issue*** 416: \* If a mustahaza woman knows that before the time for
prayers comes to an end, she will become totally Clean (*tahir/pak* ),
or if she knows that at certain time, bleeding would stop for the time
required for offering prayers she should wait and offer prayers when she
is Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 417: \* If a Mustahaza, after having done Wudhu and Ghusl,
finds that the bleeding has ceased, and she feels that if she delays the
prayers she will become fully Clean (*tahir/pak* ), within the time
required for Wudhu, Ghusl and Salat, she should delay the prayers, and
offer them after performing fresh Wudhu and Ghusl when she has become
fully Clean

(*tahir/pak* ). But if time for prayers is limited, it will not be
necessary for her to perform Wudhu and Ghusl. She should offer prayers
with the Wudhu and Ghusl which she already has.

***Issue*** 418: \* When a mustahaza woman whose bleeding has been
excessive becomes fully Clean (*tahir/pak* ), she should do Ghusl.
However, if she knows that no blood was seen after having Ghusl for the
previous prayers, it is not necessary for her to do Ghusl again. As for
medium Istihaza, it is not necessary to do Ghusl after bleeding has
stopped.

***Issue*** 419: \* Mustahaza women, with little, medium or excessive
bleeding, should commence their prayers immediately after having acted
according to their respective rules, except in the situations described
in rules 403 and 415. But to recite Adhan and Iqamah before Salat or
performing*Mustahab* acts like Qunut etc, will have no objection.

***Issue*** 420: \* If a mustahaza woman who is required to allow no
time gap between Wudhu or Ghusl and her prayers, does not act
accordingly, she would make Wudhu or do Ghusl again and then pray
without any delay.

***Issue*** 421: \* If the blood of Istihaza has a swift flow and does
not stop, and if stoppage of blood is not harmful to her, she should try
to prevent the blood from coming out after Ghusl. And if she ignores
doing so, and the blood comes out, she should offer prayers all over
again if she had already prayed. Moreover, it is a recommended
precaution that she repeats the Ghusl.

***Issue*** 422: \* If blood does not stop at the time of Ghusl the bath
is in order. But, if during the Ghusl the medium Istihaza becomes
excessive it will be necessary for her to start Ghusl all over again.

***Issue*** 423: For a Mustahaza woman who is fasting, it is a
recommended precaution that she prevents the blood from issuing out of
the body, throughout the day, as far as possible.

***Issue*** 424: \* It is widely held that the fast of a woman whose
Istihaza is excessive will be valid only if in the night preceding the
day on which she intends to fast she does Ghusl for the prayers of
Maghrib and Isha, and also does Ghusl during day time which are
obligatory for the daily prayers. But most likely, the validity of her
fasting does not depend on the Ghusl. Similarly, the validity of a woman
fasting during medium Istihaza does not depend on the Ghusl.

***Issue*** 425: \* If a woman becomes mustahaza after Asr prayers and
does not do Ghusl till sunset her fast will undoubtedly be in order.

***Issue*** 426: If a woman in little Isithaza finds out before starting
the prayers that her bleeding has become excessive or medium, she should
perform the rules prescribed for medium or excessive Istihaza as
mentioned above. And if the medium Istihaza becomes excessive she should
follow the rules prescribed for excessive Istihaza. And in case she has
done Ghusl for medium Istihaza it would not suffice, and she should do
Ghusl again for excessive Istihaza.

***Issue*** 427: \* If the medium Istihaza becomes excessive while she
is already in Salat, she should break the prayers and do Ghusl for
excessive Istihaza and also perform other relevant acts and repeat the
same prayers. And on the basis of recommended precaution she should
perform Wudhu

before Ghusl. And if she does not have time for Ghusl it is necessary
that she should perform tayammum instead of Ghusl. And if she finds that
no time is left even for tayammum then she should, on the basis of
precaution, not break the prayers and complete the same in that very
condition. It will be necessary for her to offer Qadha later. Similar
rules will apply if during the Salat her little Istihaza becomes medium
or excessive, she will have to discontinue her Salat and follow the
rules of medium or excessive Istihaza, whichever be applicable.

***Issue*** 428: \* If the blood stops during Salat and the mustahaza
woman does not know whether or not it has also stopped internally, and
if after her prayers she understands that bleeding had totally stopped,
and she has sufficient time at her disposal to offer prayers again in
the state of purity, it will be an obligatory precaution for her to act
according to the rules applicable to her and pray again.

***Issue*** 429: \* If the excessive Istihaza reduces to medium
Istihaza, the Mustahaza should perform the rules prescribed for
excessive Istihaza for the first prayers and then medium Istihaza for
the later prayers. For example, if excessive Istihaza becomes medium
before Zuhr prayers she should perform Wudhu and do Ghusl for Zuhr
prayers; and for the Asr, Maghrib and Isha prayers she should perform
only Wudhu. However, if she does not do Ghusl for Zuhr prayers and has
time for Asr prayers only she should do Ghusl for Asr prayers. And if
she does not do Ghusl for even Asr prayers she should do Ghusl for
Maghrib prayers. And if she does not do Ghusl for that prayers as well
and has just enough time for Isha prayers only, she should do Ghusl for
Isha prayers.

***Issue*** 430: \* If the excessive Istihaza stops before every Salat
and starts coming again she should do Ghusl before each Salat.

***Issue*** 431: If the excessive Istihaza reduces to little, the
mustahaza should follow for the first prayers the rules prescribed for
excessive Istihaza; and for the later prayers the rules prescribed for
little Istihaza. Similarly, if the medium Istihaza becomes little she
should follow rules prescribed for medium Istihaza for the first prayers
and those prescribed for little Istihaza for the later prayers.

***Issue*** 432: If a mustahaza woman neglects any one of the obligatory
rules, her Salat will be void.

***Issue*** 433: \* If a woman who is in little or medium Istihaza
wishes to engage in an act which requires Wudhu as a prerequisite, like
touching the script of the Quran etc., she should make the Wudhu for the
purpose. The Wudhu made specifically for Salat would not be sufficient
if she wishes to touch after the Salat is over.

***Issue*** 434: A mustahaza who has done her obligatory Ghusls can go
into Masjid, pause for some time in it, and recite the verses of the
Qur'an which contain obligatory Sajdah. It is also lawful for her
husband to have sexual intercourse with her, though she may not have
performed all the acts which are required before the prayers (e.g.
changing the cotton and the pad). And it is not unlikely that these acts
may be permissible even without Ghusl, but precaution is in avoiding
them.

***Issue*** 435: If a woman who is in the state of excessive or medium
Istihaza wishes to recite, before the time of prayers, a verse of the
Qur'an which contains an obligatory Sajdah or to enter a Masjid, she
should, on the basis of recommended precaution, do Ghusl. And the same
rule applies if her husband wishes to have sexual intercourse with her.

***Issue*** 436: \* Salatul Ayat (due to solar or lunar eclipse etc.) is
obligatory for a mustahaza woman and she should follow all the rules
which have been explained in relation with the daily prayers.

***Issue*** 437: \* When Salat al-Ayat becomes obligatory for a
mustahaza woman at the time of daily prayers and she wishes to offer
these two prayers one after the other she cannot, as per obligatory
precaution, offer both of them with one Wudhu and one Ghusl.

***Issue*** 438: \* If a mustahaza woman wishes to offer Qadha prayers
she should follow the same rules as are applicable to the prayers
offered within time. And as a precaution, she will not consider the acts
performed for prayers within time as sufficient for Qadha prayers.

***Issue*** 439: \* If a woman knows that the blood coming out of her
body is not of a wound and cannot decide on it being the blood of hayz
or nifas because of the absence of the properties defined by the
Shariah, she should act according to the rules in respect of Istihaza.
And if she doubts whether it is Istihaza or some other blood and it does
not possess other signs she should, on the basis of obligatory
precaution, follow the rules of Istihaza.

### Hayz

###

Menstrual discharge (Hayz) is a kind of blood which is normally
discharged every month from the womb of women for a few days. When
menses is discharged the woman is called 'Haaez'.

***Issue*** 440: Menses is usually thick and warm and its colour is
either black or red. It is discharged with a pressure and a little
irritation.

***Issue*** 441: \* The blood seen by women after the age of 60 years is
not classified as Hayz. And as per recommended precaution, women who are
not from the clan of Quraish, if they see blood between the age of 50
and 60 years, having the same signs as those of Hayz, they should
combine the 'dos' of mustahaza and 'don'ts' of Haaez.

***Issue*** 442: \* Blood seen by a girl who has not yet completed 9
years of her age will not be classified as Hayz.

***Issue*** 443: It is quite possible for a pregnant woman or a breast
feeding mother to see Hayz and the rules which apply to a non-pregnant
woman also apply to a pregnant one, except that if a woman who has
conceived sees blood with the usual signs of Hayz 20 days after the
commencement of her habitual period then it is necessary for her, on the
basis of precaution, to refrain from the acts which are forbidden to a
haaez and to perform the obligations of a mustahaza.

***Issue*** 444: \* If a girl does not know whether she has completed
nine years of age or not and if she sees blood which does not bear any
sign of Hayz, then that blood is definitely not Hayz. And if it has some
semblance of Hayz, even then it is difficult to classify it as Hayz,
unless one is absolutely sure. This absolute certitude will determine
that she has completed her nine years.

***Issue*** 445: \* If a woman who is doubtful as to whether or not, she
has completed 60 years of age, sees blood which she cannot decide
whether it is of Hayz or not she should decide that she has not
completed 60 years.

***Issue*** 446: The period of Hayz is not less than 3 days and not more
than 10 days and if the period during which blood is discharged falls
short of 3 days even by a small measure of time, that blood will not be
considered as Hayz.

***Issue*** 447: The blood of Hayz flows continuously for the first 3
days. Therefore, if blood is seen for 2 days and then interrupted for 1
day and then seen again for 1 day, it will not be Hayz.

***Issue*** 448: In the initial stage, it is necessary that blood flows
out, but it is not necessary to be seen flowing out during all the three
days. It is sufficient for the blood to be internally present. So, if a
woman is clean for a brief period during the first 3 days (as is common
among all or some women) even then the blood discharged will be Hayz.

***Issue*** 449: It is not necessary that a woman should have bleeding
on the 1st and the 4th night, but it is essential that bleeding should
not discontinue on the 2nd and the 3rd night. For example, if bleeding
commences on the morning of the 1st day and continues till sunset on the
3rd day, it would be considered as Hayz. Similarly, if blood is seen
from the middle of the 1st day and stops at the same time on the 4th day
the same will apply.

***Issue*** 450: \* If a woman sees blood continuously for three days,
and then it stops for a brief period before it is seen again, and if the
total number of days in which blood was seen and in which it stopped
does not exceed ten, then the days in which blood flowed will be counted
as of Hayz, and the in between period of respite will be of obligatory
precaution, during which she will do all that she should do when she is
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and also refrain from all those acts which are
forbidden to the Haaez.

***Issue*** 451: If blood is seen for more than three days and less than
ten days and she does not know whether the blood is of a sore or a wound
or of Hayz, she should not treat it as Hayz.

***Issue*** 452: If a woman sees blood about which she is unable to
discern as to whether it is the blood of wound or of Hayz, she should
continue to perform her acts of worship, except when her preceding
condition was that of Hayz.

***Issue*** 453: If a woman doubts whether the blood she has seen is of
Hayz or Istihaza, she should treat it to be Hayz if it bears the
properties of Hayz.

***Issue*** 454: If a woman is unable to decide whether the blood she
has seen is of Hayz or of virginity, she should examine herself i.e. she
should insert cotton in herself and wait for some time. If she finds
that only its sides have been stained with blood then it is virginal
blood, and if the blood has soaked the entire piece of cotton then it is
Hayz.

***Issue*** 455: \* If blood is seen for less than 3 days and then stops
and starts again for 3 days the second blood will be Hayz but the first
blood will not be considered as Hayz even if it was seen during the days
of habit.

### Rules for the Haaez

###

***Issue*** 456: \*. Acts which are Haraam for a woman who is in the
state of Hayz:-

• Prayers and other similar acts of worship for which Wudhu or tayammum
or Ghusl is necessary. However, there is no harm in her performing those
acts of worship for which Wudhu, tayammum or Ghusl are not obligatory
(e.g. Salat al-Mayyit).

• All those acts which are forbidden to a junub (see rule no. 361).

• Having sexual intercourse; it is Haraam for man as well as for woman
even if only the penis glans may penetrate, and even if semen may not be
discharged. In fact, the obligatory precaution is that the male should
refrain from insertion even to an extent lesser than the point of
circumcision. Anal intercourse with the wife is forbidden regardless of
whether she is in Hayz or not.

***Issue*** 457: Sexual intercourse is Haraam also when a woman may not
be very certain of being in the state of Hayz, but Shariah guides her to
treat herself as such. So, when a woman sees blood for more than ten
days, and, as will be explained later, she has to resort to the habit of
her relatives for determining the period of Hayz, her husband will not
be permitted to have sexual relations with her during those days.

***Issue*** 458: \* If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife when
she is a Haaez, he should seek Divine forgiveness and the recommended
precaution is that he should expiate by giving Kaffara. Rules regarding
Kaffara will be mentioned later.

***Issue*** 459: With the exception of actual sexual intercourse with a
Haaez woman, there is no harm in all other forms of courting, wooing and
kissing etc.

***Issue*** 460: Kaffara for sexual intercourse with a Haaez is gold
coins weighing 3.457 grams if carried out in the early days, 1.729 grams
for the middle days and 0.865 grams for the final days of the period of
Hayz. For example, if Hayz lasts for 6 days and her husband has sexual
intercourse with her during the 1st and 2nd days or nights, he should
pay gold weighing 3.457 grams, and during the 3rd and 4th days and
nights he should pay gold weighing 1.729 grams and for the 5th and 6th
days and nights he should pay gold weighing 0.865 grams.

***Issue*** 461: If it is not possible to pay in gold coins, he should
pay its equivalent value. And if the price of gold has undergone a
change at the time he wishes to pay the Kaffara to the poor, as compared
with the time when he had sexual intercourse, he should pay at the
prevailing rate.

***Issue*** 462: If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife in the
first, second and third stage of Hayz he should give Kaffara for all the
three, totalling 6.051 grams.

***Issue*** 463: If a man has had repeated sexual intercourse with a
Haeez woman he should pay Kaffara for each time.

***Issue*** 464: If a man realises during the course of sexual
intercourse that the woman has become Haaez, he should withdraw from her
immediately, and if he does not do so the recommended precaution is that
he should pay Kaffara.

***Issue*** 465: If a man commits fornication with a Haaez woman or has
sexual intercourse with a Haaez woman who is not his 'mahram' under the
impression that she is his wife, the recommended precaution in this
case, too, is that he should pay Kaffara.

***Issue*** 466: If a man has sexual intercourse with a Haaez woman on
account of ignorance or because of having forgotten the rule, he need
not pay Kaffara.

***Issue*** 467: If a man has sexual intercourse with a woman with the
belief that she is Haaez, but it transpires later that she was not
Haaez, he need not pay Kaffara.

***Issue*** 468: As will be explained in the rule relating to divorce,
if a woman is divorced while she is in the state of Hayz, the divorce is
void.

***Issue*** 469: \* If a woman says that she is Haaez, or claims to have
become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from Hayz, her statement should be accepted,
provided that she is not known to be unreliable.

***Issue*** 470: If a woman becomes Haaez while she is in Salat, her
Salat will become void.

***Issue*** 471: If a woman has doubt while offering prayers whether or
not she has become Haaez, her prayer is in order. However, if she
realises after offering prayers that she had actually become Haaez
during the prayers, her prayers will be void.

***Issue*** 472: After a woman becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from Hayz it
is obligatory for her to take bath for the prayers and other acts of
worship which require Wudhu or Ghusl or tayammum. The rules for this
Ghusl are

the same as for the Ghusl of Janabat. And it is better that before Ghusl
she should perform Wudhu.

***Issue*** 473: \* After a woman has become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from
Hayz, and before having done Ghusl the divorce given to her will be in
order, and her husband can also have sexual intercourse with her. Though
it is better to have sexual intercourse after the woman has washed
herself. However, the recommended precaution is that the man should
avoid having sexual intercourse with her before she has done Ghusl.
However, until she has had Ghusl, other acts like staying in a Masjid
and touching the writing of the Qur'an which were Haraam for her at the
time of Hayz do not become Halal for her.

***Issue*** 474: \* If the woman does not have sufficient water for
Wudhu and Ghusl, and if it is just enough for Ghusl only, she should do
Ghusl, and it is better that she should perform tayammum in place of
Wudhu. And if the water is sufficient for performing Wudhu only, she
should perform Wudhu and perform tayammum instead of Ghusl. And if she
does not have water for either of them (i.e. for Ghusl or Wudhu) she
should perform tayammum for Ghusl only. It is recommended that she does
one more tayammum instead of Wudhu also.

***Issue*** 475: \* There is no Qadha for the Salat which she left
during her Hayz, but she should give Qadha for the obligatory fasts
missed by her due to Hayz. This includes even those fasts which had
been*Wajib* upon her on the fixed days because of Nadhr, but she could
not keep because of Hayz.

***Issue*** 476: \* If the time for prayers sets in and a woman knows,
or considers it probable, that if she delays offering prayers she will
become Haaez, she should offer prayers immediately.

***Issue*** 477: \* If a woman delays offering prayers on exact time,
allowing a lapse equal to the time required for offering one Salat
together with Wudhu or tayammum, and then she becomes Haaez, she will
have to give Qadha for that Salat. And in calculating the time, the
extraneous things like praying quickly or slowly and other matters have
to be considered individually. For example, if a woman who is not a
traveller delays her Salat of Zuhr, the Qadha will be obligatory for her
if time equal to performing four rak'ats of prayers along with Wudhu or
tayammum passes away from the exact time of Zuhr and then she becomes
Haaez. And for one who is a traveller the passage of time equal to
performing two rak'ats along with Wudhu or tayammum is sufficient.

***Issue*** 478: If a woman is Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from Hayz when the
time for prayers is nearing its end, and has at her disposal time which
suffices for Ghusl and performing one rak'at or more, she should offer
the prayers and if she fails to do so she should offer its Qadha.

***Issue*** 479: \* If a Haaez finds that she does not have sufficient
time for Ghusl, but she can offer prayers within the prescribed time
after performing tayammum, the obligatory precaution is that she should
offer that prayer with tayammum, and even if she did not offer that
prayer it will be obligatory for her to offer its Qadha. Again, if
tayammum is incumbent upon her due to other reasons, like, if water is
harmful for her, she should

perform tayammum and offer that prayer, and if she does not offer it,
she will have to give its Qadha.

***Issue*** 480: If after becoming Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from Hayz, a
woman doubts whether or not she has time left for the prayers, she
should offer the prayers.

***Issue*** 481: \* If after becoming Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from Hayz a
woman does not offer prayers under the impression that she does not have
time to make necessary preparations for prayers and to offer even one
rak'at, but understands later that she did have time for the purpose,
she should offer Qadha.

***Issue*** 482: It is*Mustahab* for a Haaez that when it is time for
Salat, she makes herself Clean (*tahir/pak* ) by washing away blood, and
changing the pad. Then she should make Wudhu or tayammum, whichever is
applicable, and sit at the place meant for prayers facing Qibla and busy
herself in recital, supplication and salutations (Salawat).

***Issue*** 483: It is Makrooh for a haaez to read the holy Qur'an, or
keep it with herself, or touch with any part of her body the space
between its lines. It is also Makrooh for her to dye her hair with
“henna” or any other thing like it.

### Types of Women in Hayz

###

***Issue 484: There are six types:***

• Woman having the habit of time and duration: A woman who sees blood in
each of the two consecutive months at a particular time and for a fixed
number of days. For example, in each month blood may be seen from the
1st up to the 7th of the month.

• Woman having the habit of time: A woman who sees blood in each of the
two consecutive months at a particular time but the number of days
varies. For example, in two consecutive months her blood starts coming
on the 1st of the month but she becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) on the 7th
day in the first month and on the 8th day in the second month.

• Woman having the habit of duration: A woman who sees blood in each of
the two consecutive months for a particular number of days but the time
of commencement is not the same. For example, in the first month the
blood is seen from the 5th to the 10th of the month and in the second
month from the 12th to the 17th of that month.

• Muztariba: A woman who has seen blood for a few months but who has not
formed a habit or whose former habit has been disturbed and has not
formed a new one.

• Mubtadiya: A woman who sees blood for the first time.

• Nasiya: A woman who has forgotten her habit.

### Some Further Details are Given Below About Haaez:

###

***Issue*** 485: \* Women having the habit of time and duration are of
two types: First, a woman who sees blood in two consecutive months at a
particular time for a particular duration. For example, she sees blood
on the 1st of each month and becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) on the 7th of
each month. Her habit of Hayz will be from first to seventh of every
month.

Second, a woman who sees blood in each of the two consecutive months at
a particular time and after 3 or more days she may be Clean (*tahir/pak*
) for one or more days and the blood is seen again; but the total number
of days during which the blood is seen as well as those during which she
remains Clean (*tahir/pak* ) does not exceed 10 days; and in each month
the total number of days during which blood is seen, and the intervening
days during which she is Clean (*tahir/pak* ) must be same. In such a
case the habit of the woman will be counted according to the days during
which blood is seen, not including the intervening days during which she
remained Clean (*tahir/pak* ). It is not, however, necessary that the
intervening days during which she remains Clean (*tahir/pak* ) should be
identical in each month. For example,if in the 1st month blood is seen
for 3 days from the 1st to the 3rd of the month and then she remains
Clean (*tahir/pak* ) for 3 days whereas in the 2nd month the blood comes
for 3 days and then it stops coming for 3 days and is seen again for 3
days and the total number of days during which the blood is seen is six,
then this woman will be classified as having a fixed habit of six days.
If the number of days during which blood is seen varies in the second
month, then she is one with fixed time but not fixed duration.

***Issue*** 486: \* If a woman who has a fixed habit of time,
irrespective of whether she has a fixed habit of duration or not, sees
blood on time or a day or two earlier that blood will be Hayz even if it
does not bear the signs of Hayz. Therefore, she will act according the
rules applied to a Haaez. And if it transpires that it was not Hayz, for
example, if she becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) before three days, then she
should give Qadha for the acts of Ibadaat which she has left out.

***Issue*** 487: \* If a woman having the habit of time and duration
sees blood during all days of her fixed habit plus a few days before and
after, and if the total number of days does not exceed 10, all of it is
Hayz. And if it exceeds 10 days, then only the blood seen during the
days of habit is Hayz and the rest will be Istihaza, and she should give
Qadha of the acts of worship which she did not perform during the days
before and after her habit. And if she sees blood on all the days of her
habit as well as a few days earlier, and if the total number of the days
does not exceed 10, all of it is Hayz. And if it exceeds ten days, then
blood seen during the days of habit will be Hayz, even if it did not
have the signs of Hayz, and the blood seen earlier will be classified as
Istihaza even if it had the signs of Hayz. She will offer Qadha for the
prayers left out during those earlier days. And if she sees blood during
her days of fixed habit plus a few days after her habit, and if the
total does not exceed ten days, all of it is Hayz. But if it exceeds ten
days, then the blood seen during habitual days will be Hayz, and the
rest is Istihaza.

***Issue*** 488: \* If a woman who has the fixed habit of time and
duration, sees blood on some days of her habit and also a few days
earlier and if the total number of days does not exceed 10 days, all of
it is Hayz. And if the number of days exceeds 10 she will add the number
of days within her habitual time to the earlier days and complete her
fixed duration. Those will be the days of Hayz, and the rest will be
Istihaza.

And if she sees blood during some of her habitual days plus some days
later, and if the total number of days does not exceed ten, then all of
it will be Hayz.

And if the total exceeds ten days then she will add the number of her
habitual time to the later days so as to complete her fixed period of
duration. These will then be the days of Hayz, and the rest will be
classified as Istihaza.

***Issue*** 489: \* If a woman has a fixed habit of Hayz and if she sees
blood for 3 days or more, and then it stops and is thereafter seen
again, and the gap between the two discharges is less than 10 days, and
if the total number of days in which blood was seen together with the
intermediary period in which it stopped exceeds 10 days (e.g. when blood
is seen for 5 days and then stops for 5 days and is again seen on the
following 5 days) then it has various rules:-

• If the blood, all or part thereof, seen in the initial days was during
the days of her habit and the blood seen later in the second phase after
her temporary state of being Clean (*tahir/pak* ) did not come during
the days of her habit, then she should treat her first blood to be Hayz
and the second one as Istihaza.

• If the blood seen in the initial days is not during the days of her
habit but the second blood, all or part therof was seen in the days of
her habit, then she should treat the entire second blood to be Hayz and
the first as Istihaza.

• If she saw the first and the second blood during the days of her
habit, and if the first blood did not last for less than 3 days, then
that period along with the intervening days when she was Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) will be period of Hayz, provided that the total period
covered by them does not exceed 10 days. And as per obligatory
precaution, she will do all that a Clean (*tahir/pak* ) lady does and
refrain from all that a Haaez is forbidden to do during the intervening
period. And some of the blood which she continues to see after the days
of her habit will be classified as Istihaza. But the blood which she may
see a day or two earlier than her habitual time can be Hayz, as it
customarily occurs in some cases of women with fixed habit. But if she
finds that by counting the earlier discharge as Hayz, the blood which
she saw in the second phase during her habitual period will be counted
out of the ten days limit then she will consider the earlier discharge
as Istihaza. For example, if her habit was to see blood on 3rd to 10th
of every month, and during any one month the habit changed and she saw
blood from 1st to 6th, and then remained Clean (*tahir/pak* ) for two
days. Thereafter, she saw blood again till 15th. The rule will be that
the blood seen from 1st to 10th is Hayz, and that seen from 11th to 15th
is Istihaza.

• If she sees the blood in both phases during her habitual days, but
blood seen in the initial days is for less than three days, then it is
plausible that she may add the days of earlier discharge to complete
three days, and treat the period as Hayz. Then the second blood which
also fell during habitual days will be counted as Hayz, provided that
the total of the first and second phase, together with the intervening
days of pause does not exceed ten days.

In certain situations, she has to regard all the blood seen in the
initial period as Hayz, but there are two conditions for that:-

1. The discharge seen earlier than the habitual days must be
customarily expected.

2. By considering the whole initial period as Hayz, blood seen in
the second phase of habitual days is not excluded from ten days'
maximum. For example, if a woman has a habit of seeing blood from 4th to
10th of every month, and she saw it earlier, say, from 1st to 4th, and
then there was a brief period when blood stopped, say, for two days. And
again it continued upto 15th. The rule is that all blood seen in the
first phase is Hayz, and in the second one, blood seen upto the tenth
will be Hayz. The rest will be Istihaza.

***Issue*** 490: If a woman with fixed habit of time and duration fails
to see blood in her habit, and sees it earlier or later, it will be
considered as Hayz if it comes for the equal number of days, and bears
the signs.

***Issue*** 491: \* If a woman who has the habit of time and duration
sees blood in her habit for three or more days, but for less than her
usual number of days and then her blood stops and thereafter is seen
again for days equal to the number of days of her habit, she will treat
the whole period, including the intervening days, as one Hayz, if it
does not exceed ten days. But if the number of intervening days during
which she is Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from blood is ten days or more, then
each period of bleeding will be regarded as a separate period of Hayz.

And if the intervening gap is less than 10 days, but the total of first,
second and intervening period exceeds ten days, then the first phase
will be Hayz, and the second one Istihaza.

***Issue*** 492: If a woman who has fixed habit of time and duration
sees blood for more than 10 days, the blood which she sees during the
days of her habit is Hayz, even though it may not have the signs of
Hayz, and the blood which is seen after the days of her habit is
Istihaza even though it may have the sign of Hayz. For example, if the
blood of a woman whose habit is from the 1st to the 7th of the month is
seen from the 1st to the 12th of a particular month, the blood which is
seen during the first 7 days will be Hayz and that which is seen during
the remaining 5 days will be Istihaza.

Women Having the Habit of Time Only

### Women having the habit of time are of two types:

###

***Issue*** 493: First, a woman who sees blood in each of the two
consecutive months on a given day, and then becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* )
after a few days. The duration of blood varies in each month. For
example, if the blood is seen on the 1st of each month but stops on the
7th in the first month and on the 8th in the second month, her habit of
time will be the first of every month.

Second, a woman who sees blood in two consecutive months on a given day,
for, say 3 or more days and then it stops and thereafter is seen again,
but the total number of days does not exceed ten days. However, the
number of days during the 2nd month is either more or less than the days
in the 1st month. For example, if the blood is seen on the 1st day of
each of the two consecutive months but the total duration of days is 8
in the 1st month and 9

in the 2nd month, she should treat the 1st of the month to be her habit
of time.

***Issue*** 494: \* If a woman who has the habit of time but the
duration of her hayz is not constant, sees blood on her habitual time or
two or three days earlier, she will treat herself as Haaez, and act
according to the details given in rule no. 486. But if the blood is seen
much earlier, so much so that it would not be considered as customary,
or if she sees it very late, she will treat herself as Haaez if the
blood bears the signs of Hayz. Similarly, she will consider it as Hayz
if she is sure that the bleeding will continue for three days, even if
the blood bears no semblance of Hayz.

And if she is not sure whether this sort of bleeding will last for three
days or not, then as per obligatory precaution, she will do all those
acts which are wajib for a Mustahaza, and refrain from all those acts
which are forbidden to Haaez.

***Issue*** 495: \* If a woman with the fixed habit of time sees blood
on her habitual time for more than 10 days and if she is unable to
determine the exact duration of Hayz from its signs, then as a
precaution, she will follow the habit of her paternal or maternal
relatives, irrespective of whether they are living or dead; provided
that:

1. the state of her relative does not differ sharply from her state.
She, as a young and active person, cannot compare with the habit of an
old lady, or the one nearing menopause.

2. She does not compare herself to a woman in her family whose habit is
totally different from the habit of the others in the family.

The above rule also applies to a woman of fixed habit of time who fails
to see blood on time, and sees it out of the days of her habit for more
than 10 days and is unable to discern from the signs.

***Issue*** 496: \* A woman with fixed habit of time cannot shift her
Hayz to any period outside her habitual time. Therefore, if her
commencing time is fixed on the first of every month, with a varying
duration of five or six days, and then suddenly she sees blood for
twelve days, and she is unable to recognise the signs to determine the
duration of Hayz, she will take the first day of the month as the
beginning and as for the duration, she will resort to the foregoing rule
(495). And if she is aware of her final or middle days of habit, and if
the total number of days exceeds ten, she will arrange the duration of
Hayz in such a manner that her final or middle days fall within the
habitual time.

***Issue*** 497: \* If a woman with a fixed habit of time sees blood for
more than ten days, and is unable to determine the nature of blood as
explained in rule no. 495, then she will be free to decide upon any
number of days which she feels could be her days of Hayz. It is
recommended that she fixes seven days, and in so doing she must keep in
mind her habit of commencement, as mentioned in the foregoing rules.

### Women Having the Habit of Fixed Duration

###

#### Women having the habit of duration are of two types:

####

***Issue*** 498: \* First, a woman whose duration of Hayz in two
consecutive months is same but the commencing times differ. In such
circumstances her

habit of duration will be the number of days during which blood is seen.
For example, if blood is seen from the 1st to the 5th of the 1st month
and from the 11th to the 15th of the 2nd month her duration habit will
be 5 days.

Second, a woman who sees blood in two consecutive months for 3 or more
days, and then it stops for a day or two before it starts again, though
the time of commencement of blood varies in the 2nd month from that of
the 1st, her duration habit will be the number of days during which
blood is seen, provided that the total number of the bleeding and Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) days does not exceed ten and that the duration period in
both the months remains equal. As a measure of precaution, in the
intervening days, she will do all that is obligatory upon a lady who is
Clean (*tahir/pak* ), and also refrain from all those acts which a Haaez
is forbidden to do. For example, if during the 1st month she sees blood
from the 1st to the 3rd day and then it stops for 2 days and then sees
again for 3 days, and in the 2nd month she sees it from the 11th to the
13th and then it stops for 2 days and then sees it her duration habit
will be six days. And if the duration in two consecutive months is not
constant, like, if she sees blood for 8 days in the first month and for
4 days in the next, then a pause, and again bleeding starts making the
total 8 days by including the intervening days, then such a woman cannot
be classified as woman with fixed duration. She will be Mudhtariba,
whose rules will be discussed later.

***Issue*** 499: \* If a woman with the fixed habit of duration sees
blood for less or more days than her habitual duration, but the number
of those days does not exceed 10 she should treat them as Hayz. And if
it exceeds 10 days and the nature of blood remains same throughout, then
she will calculate her habitual duration from the day bleeding began,
and treat it as Hayz. But if the nature of blood changes, with some days
showing signs of Hayz and others showing signs of Istihaza, then there
can be three possibilities:-

1. if the number of days in which blood shows signs of Hayz tallies with
the habitual duration, then she will take those days as of Hayz, and the
rest as Istihaza.

2. if the number of days in which blood shows signs of Hayz exceeds her
habitual duration, then she will take her habitual duration as Hayz, and
the rest as Istihaza.

3. if the number of days in which blood shows signs of Hayz is less than
her habitual duration, she will add some days to complete her duration
and take that period as Hayz, and treat the rest of the days as of
Istihaza.

### Mudhtaribah

###

***Issue*** 500: \* Mudhtaribah is a woman who may have seen blood for
some months, but did not form a fixed habit, neither of time nor of
duration. If such a woman sees blood for more than 10 days, and if the
nature of blood remains same, either resembling Hayz or Istihaza, then
she will be classified among those women who, despite fixed habit of
time, see blood in unusual period, and is also unable to distinguish the
signs of one from the other.

As a measure of precaution, she will refer to the prevailing habits
among her relatives and adopt it. And if that is not possible, she will
fix any

reasonable number, neither less than 3 days nor more than ten days, as
explained in rules nos.495 and 497.

***Issue*** 501: \* If Mudhtaribah sees blood for more than ten days,
and if for some days the blood has the signs of Hayz and during other
days has the signs of Istihaza, and if the blood which has the signs of
Hayz is not less than 3 days nor more than 10 days, then all of it is
Hayz. The rest will be Istihaza.

And if the blood bearing the signs of Hayz is for less than 3 days or
more than 10 days, she will follow the rule explained in the foregoing
clause for the sake of determining the number of days in Hayz.

And if after having determined her Hayz period, she again sees blood
before completing 10 days of being Clean (*tahir/pak* ), again with the
signs of Hayz, she will treat this new emission as Istihaza.

### Mubtadea

###

***Issue*** 502: \* Mubtadea is a woman who sees blood for the first
time. If she sees it for more than ten days and all the blood has common
signs then she should refer to the prevailing habit among her relatives
and consider her corresponding duration as Hayz and the rest as
Istihaza, keeping in view two provisions in rule no. 495. And if even
that seems impossible, then she will be free to fix a certain duration
as explained in rule no. 497.

***Issue*** 503: \* If a Mubtadea sees blood for more than ten days,
some bearing the signs of Hayz and other that of Istihaza, and if the
blood with the signs of Hayz is seen for not less than three and not
more than ten days, then all that blood is Hayz. But if she sees blood
again before the expiry of ten days and even that blood resembles Hayz,
for example, if dark blood is seen for five days and yellowish blood is
seen for nine days, and dark blood is seen again for five days, then she
should treat the first blood as Hayz and the rest as Istihaza, as
explained in the case of Mudhtaribah.

***Issue*** 504: \* If a Mubtadea sees blood for more than 10 days, some
of which bearing signs of Hayz and other having signs of Istihaza, and
if the blood with the signs of Hayz is seen for less than 3 days, she
will treat it as Hayz, and for determining the duration of it she will
follow as stated in rule no. 501.

### Nasiya

###

***Issue*** 505: \* Nasiya is a woman who has forgotten her habit of
time and duration, and such women are of various types.

One of them is a woman who had a fixed habit of duration, and has now
forgotten it. If she sees blood for three or more days, not exceeding
ten, she will treat all of it as Hayz.

But if she sees blood for more than ten days, then she is classified as
Mudhtaribah, and she will follow rule nos. 500 and 501, with one
difference. While determining her duration, she must know that the
duration she is fixing is not less than her usual habit, nor can she fix
a longer duration than her usual habit.

Similar is the case of a woman who had a fixed duration, but it slightly
varied each month, for example, she saw blood for six days, and at times
for seven days in a month. Such a woman, if she is unable to decide on
the basis

of signs, or the habit of her relatives etc. then she should fix her
duration within the limits of six and seven days.

### Various Rules Related to Hayz

###

***Issue*** 506: \* If a Mubtadea, a Mudhtaribah, a Nasiya and a woman
with the fixed habit of duration, see blood with the signs of Hayz, or
are certain that the discharge would last for three days, they must
abandon the obligatory prayers. But if they later understand that it was
not Hayz, they have to give the Qadha of the prayers they did not
perform.

***Issue*** 507: If a woman has a fixed habit of Hayz, either of time or
of duration or of both, and if she sees blood for two consecutive months
contrary to her usual habit in which she finds that the time, the
duration or both coincide then she has formed a new habit. For example,
if previously she saw blood from 1st to 7th of a month but during these
two months she saw it from the 10th to 17th, then the period from 10th
to 17th of the month will be her new habit.

***Issue*** 508: “One month” means the expiry of 30 days from the date
of commencement of Hayz and not the period from the first to the last
date of a month.

***Issue*** 509: If a woman usually sees blood once in a month, but in a
particular month she sees it twice with signs of Hayz, and if the number
of intervening days during which she remained Clean (*tahir/pak* ) is
not less than 10 she should treat both as periods of Hayz.

***Issue*** 510: If a woman sees blood with signs of Hayz for 3 or more
days and thereafter for 10 or more she sees blood with the signs of
Istihaza and again she sees blood with signs of Hayz for 3 days, she
should treat the first and last bleeding as Hayz.

***Issue*** 511: \* If a woman becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) before the
expiry of 10 days and feels that there is no blood in her interior part
she should do Ghusl for the acts of worship although she may have a
feeling that blood might appear once again before the completion of 10
days. And if she is absolutely sure that she will see blood before the
lapse of 10 days, even then, as a matter of precaution, she should do
Ghusl and perform her Ibadaat, but she will refrain from doing those
acts which are forbidden to a Haaez.

***Issue*** 512: \* If a woman becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) before 10
days but feels that there might be blood in her interior part, she
should insert cotton and wait for some time to find out. If she finds
out that she has become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) she should take bath and
perform her acts of worship. And if she finds out that she has not
become Clean (*tahir/pak* ) totally, and she does not have a fixed habit
of Hayz or if her habit is 10 days, or if she has a fixed duration which
is not yet completed, then she will wait. If she becomes Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) before ten days, she will do Ghusl. If she becomes Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) on completion of 10 days, or if her bleeding exceeds ten
days, then she will do Ghusl at the end of tenth day.

And if her habit is for less than 10 days, and she is sure that the
blood will cease before ten days are over, or by the end of the tenth
day, she must not do Ghusl till then. And if she has a feeling that her
bleeding might exceed ten days, it is a recommended precaution that she
avoids acts of

worship for a day, or upto the tenth day. But this rule applies to those
women who have had continuous bleeding before the days of her habit.
Otherwise, it is not permissible to neglect Ibadaat after the days of
habit are over.

***Issue*** 513: If a woman treats the blood she saw during certain days
as Hayz and did not perform her acts of worship and comes to know later
that it was not Hayz, she should give Qadha of the lapsed prayers, and
fasts, which she left out. And if she performs acts of worship under the
impression that the blood is not Hayz but realises later that it was
Hayz, then the fasts kept in those days will be void and therefore she
should give Qadha of those fasts.

### Nifas

###

***Issue*** 514: From the time when the child birth takes place, the
blood seen by the mother is Nifas, provided that it stops before or on
completion of the tenth day. While in the condition of Nifas, a woman is
called Nafsa.

***Issue*** 515: The blood which a mother sees before the appearance of
the first limb of the child is not Nifas.

***Issue*** 516: It is not necessary that the baby is fully grown. Even
if a deficient baby is born, the blood seen by the mother for ten days
will be Nifas. The term 'Child birth' must be applicable to it.

***Issue*** 517: It is possible that Nifas blood may be discharged for
an instant only, but it never exceeds 10 days.

***Issue*** 518: If a woman doubts whether she has aborted something or
not, or whether the thing aborted is a child or not, it is not necessary
for her to investigate, and the blood which is discharged in this
situation is not Nifas.

***Issue*** 519: On the basis of precaution, halting or pausing in a
masjid and other acts which are haraam for a Haaez are also haraam for a
Nafsa and those acts which are obligatory for a Haaez are also
obligatory for a Nafsa.

***Issue*** 520: Divorcing a woman who is in the state of Nifas and
having sexual intercourse with her is haraam. However, if her husband
has sexual intercourse with her it does not involve any Kaffara.

***Issue*** 521: \* When a woman becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from
Nifas, she should do Ghusl and perform acts of worship. And if she sees
blood again, once or often, and the total number of days on which blood
is seen and the intervening days during which she remains Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) is 10 or less than 10, then all of it will be Nifas. In
the intervening days, as a precaution, she will perform all that is
obligatory for a Clean (*tahir/pak* ) woman and also refrain from all
acts which are forbidden to a woman in Nifas. So, if she had kept fasts,
she will give their Qadha.

And if the blood which she saw later exceeds ten days then there can be
two situations:

1. if the woman does not have a fixed habit of duration, then she will
count the first ten days as Nifas, and the rest as Istihaza.

2. and if she has fixed habit of duration, then, as a precaution, the
blood which she sees after the habitual days of duration will require
her to act as a Mustahaza, and also avoid all that is forbidden to a
woman in Nifas.

***Issue*** 522: If a woman becomes Clean (*tahir/pak* ) from Nifas, but
feels that there might be blood in the interior part, she should insert
some cotton, and wait till she finds out. If she finds herself Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) then she should do Ghusl for the acts of worship.

***Issue*** 523: \* If Nifas blood is seen by a mother for more than 10
days and she has a fixed habit of Hayz, then her Nifas will be equal to
the duration of Hayz and the rest would be Istihaza. And, if she does
not have a fixed habit of Hayz, she would take ten days as those of
Hayz, and treat the rest as Istihaza.

For a woman who has a fixed habit of Hayz, it is a recommended
precaution to act as a Mustahaza from the day after her habit is over,
and at the same time refrain from acts forbidden to one in Nifas till
18th day. And for a woman with no fixed habit of Hayz, this recommended
precaution applies from the tenth to the eighteenth day since the child
birth.

***Issue*** 524: \* If the habit of Hayz of a woman is less than 10 days
and blood is seen for more days than the days of her Hayz, she should
treat the days equal to the days of her Hayz as Nifas. After that, she
has a choice either to leave out her Salat or act according to the rules
of Istihaza, but it is better to leave out Salat for a day. And if the
blood continues to be seen even after 10 days, then all the days in
excess of her habit, upto the tenth day, will be Istihaza and she should
give Qadha of the acts of worship which she did not perform during those
days. For example, if the Hayz duration of a woman has always been 6
days and her blood comes for more than 6 days, she should treat 6 days
as Nifas and on the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th day, it will be her choice
either to abstain from all acts of worship or adopt the rules of
Istihaza. And if she sees blood for more than ten days, all the days in
excess of her habitual duration of Hayz will be treated as the days of
Istihaza.

***Issue*** 525: \* If a woman, with a fixed habit of Hayz sees blood
continuously for a month or more after giving birth to a child, the
blood seen for the days equal to her Hayz habit will be Nifas, and the
blood seen after that for ten days will be Istihaza, even if it
coincides with the dates of her monthly Hayz.

For example, there is a woman whose fixed Hayz habit is from 20th to
27th of every month.

She gives birth on the 10th of a given month, and she continues to see
blood for a month or more; her Nifas will be seven days, equal to her
Hayz days, and will be from 10th to 17th of that month; now, the blood
which she continues to see from the 17th onwards for ten days will be
Istihaza, even though it falls in her days of Hayz habit.

After the lapse of 10 days, if bleeding continues, then it is Hayz if it
falls in the days of habit, irrespective of whether it has the signs of
Hayz or not.

And if bleeding does not occur in the days of Hayz habit, she will wait
till the days of her habit, even if it means waiting for a month or more
and even if blood has the signs of Hayz.

And if she has no fixed habit of commencement time of Hayz, she should
make an effort to recognise her Hayz by its signs; and if that is not
possible, because the blood seen after Nifas remains of one type for a
month or more, then she will adopt the habit prevailing among her
relatives to determine the days of Hayz. And, if that also is not
possible, then she has an option of fixing her days of Hayz. These
details have been dealt with in the discussions about Hayz.

***Issue*** 526: \* If a woman does not have a fixed habit of duration,
and if after giving birth she sees blood continuously for a month or
more, the rules contained in no. 523 will apply to the first 10 days;
and as for the next 10 days it is Istihaza. And as regards the blood
seen thereafter, it can be either Hayz or Istihaza, and in order to
ascertain whether it is Hayz, she will follow the rule stated in the
foregoing clause.

Ghusl for Touching a Dead Body
------------------------------

***Issue*** 527: If a person touches a human dead body which has become
cold and has not yet been given Ghusl (i.e. brings any part of his own
body in contact with it) he should do Ghusl regardless of whether he
touched it while asleep or awake, voluntarily or otherwise. Ghusl will
also be wajib if his nail or bone touches the nail or bone of the dead
body. However, Ghusl is not obligatory if one touches a dead animal.

***Issue*** 528: If a person touches a dead body which has not become
entirely cold, Ghusl will not be wajib, even if the part touched has
become cold.

***Issue*** 529: \* If a person brings his hair in contact with the body
of a dead person, or if his body touches the hair of the dead person, or
if his hair touches the hair of the dead person, Ghusl will not become
obligatory.

***Issue*** 530: \* If a person touches a dead child or a foetus in
which life has entered, then Ghusl for touching it will be obligatory.
Hence, if a still-born child whose body has become cold, comes in
contact with the outer part of its mother's body, the mother should do
Ghusl for touching the dead body. In fact, as an obligatory precaution,
she should do Ghusl even if the child has not touched the outer part of
her body.

***Issue*** 531: \* A child who is born after its mother has died, and
her body has become cold, and if it touches any outer part of mother's
dead body, it should do Ghusl on attaining the age of puberty. In fact,
it should do Ghusl, as a precaution, even if it did not touch the
mother's body.

***Issue*** 532: If a person touches a dead body after it has been given
three obligatory Ghusls, Ghusl for touching will not be wajib. However,
if he touches any part of the dead body before the completion of 3
Ghusls he should do Ghusl for touching the dead body, even if the 3rd
Ghusl of that part which he has touched may have been done.

***Issue*** 533: If an insane person or a minor touches a dead body, the
insane person would do Ghusl when he becomes sane, and similarly the
minor child would do Ghusl when he attains the age of puberty.

***Issue*** 534: \* If a part is separated from a living person, or from
a dead body which has not yet been given Ghusls, and a person touches
that separated part he does not have to do any Ghusl even if that
separated part contains bones.

***Issue*** 535: \* It is not obligatory to do Ghusl for touching a
separated bone which has not been given Ghusl, whether it has been
separated from a dead body or a living person. The same rule applies to
touching the teeth which have been separated form a dead body or a
living person.

***Issue*** 536: The method of doing Ghusl for touching the dead body is
the same as of Ghusl for Janabat. However, for a person who has done
Ghusl for touching a dead body, the recommended precaution is that he
should perform Wudhu if he wants to pray.

***Issue*** 537: One Ghusl is sufficient for one who touches several
corpses or touches the same corpse a number of times.

***Issue*** 538: A person who has not done Ghusl after touching a dead
body is not prohibited from halting or pausing in a masjid or from
having sexual intercourse with his wife, or from reciting the verses of
the holy Qur'an

which have obligatory Sajdah. However, he should do Ghusl for offering
prayers or for other similar acts of worship.

Rules Related to a Dying Person
-------------------------------

***Issue*** 539: A Muslim who is dying, whether man or woman, old or
young, should, as a measure of precaution, be laid on his/her back if
possible, in such a manner that the soles of his/her feet would face the
Qibla (direction towards the holy Ka'bah)

***Issue*** 540: It is recommended that the dead body should be laid
facing the Qibla during the Ghusls. However, when Ghusls are completed,
it is better to lay it the same way as it is laid when prayers are
offered for it.

***Issue*** 541: \* It is an obligatory precaution upon every Muslim, to
lay a dying person facing the Qibla. And if the dying person consents to
it, there is no need to seek the permission for it from the guardian.
Otherwise, the permission must be sought.

***Issue*** 542: It is recommended that the doctrinal testimony of Islam
(Shahadatain) and the acknowledgement of the twelve Imams and other
tenets of faith should be inculcated to a dying person in such a manner
that he/she would understand. It is also recommended that these
utterances are repeated till the time of his/her death.

***Issue*** 543: It is recommended that the following supplications
should be read over to a dying person in such a manner that he/she would
understand: Allahhummaghfir liyal kathira mim ma'asika waqbal minniyal
yasira min ta'atika ya man yaqbalul yasira wa ya'afu 'anil kathir, Iqbal
minniyal yasira wa'fu 'anniyal kathir. Innaka antal 'afuwwul Ghafur.
Alla hum mar hamni fa innaka Rahim.

***Issue*** 544: It is*Mustahab* to carry a person experiencing
painfully slow death to the place where he used to offer prayers,
provided that it does not cause him any discomfort.

***Issue*** 545: If a person is in the throes of death it is*Mustahab*
to recite by his side Surah Yasin, Surah as-Saffat, Surah al-Ahzab, Ayat
al-Kursi and 54th verse of Surah al-A'raf and the last three verses of
Surah al-Baqarah. In fact it is better to recite as much from the holy
Qur'an as possible.

***Issue*** 546: \* It is Makrooh to leave a dying person alone or to
place a weight on his stomach, or to chatter idly or wail near him or to
let only women remain with him. It is Makrooh to be by his/her side in
the state of Janabat or Hayz.

### Rules to Follow After the Death

###

***Issue*** 547: \* It is*Mustahab* that the eyes and lips of a dead
person be shut, its chin be tied, its hands and feet be straightened and
to spread a cloth over it. If a person dies at night it is*Mustahab* to
light the place where he/she is, to inform Momineen to join the funeral,
and to hasten the burial. But if, they are not sure of his/her death,
they should wait till they are certain. Moreover, if the dead person is
a pregnant woman and there is a living child in her womb, her burial
should be delayed till such time that her left side is cut open and the
child is taken out and then to sew her side.

### The Obligation of Ghusl, Kafan, Salat and Dafn

###

***Issue*** 548: \* Giving Ghusl, Kafan, Hunoot, Salat, and burial to
every dead Muslim, regardless of whether he/she is an Ithna-Asheri or
not, is wajib on the guardian.The guardian must either discharge all
these duties

himself or appoint someone to do them. And if anyone performs these
duties, with or without the permission of the guardian, the guardian
will be relieved of his responsibility. And if the dead person had no
guardian, or if the guardian refuses to discharge his duties, then these
duties will be obligatory upon all equally, as*Wajib* al-Kifaee which
means if some people undertake to fulfil the obligation, others will be
relieved of the responsibility. And if no one undertakes to do so, all
will be equally sinful. And when a guardian refuses to discharge his
duty, seeking his permission has no meaning.

***Issue*** 549: If a person undertakes to fulfil the obligations to a
dead body it is not obligatory on others to proceed for the same.
However, if that person leaves the work half done, others must complete
them.

***Issue*** 550: \* If a person is certain that others are fulfiling
their obligations properly, then it is not obligatory for him to proceed
for the purpose.However, if he is in doubt or has suspicion, then he
should take necessary steps.

***Issue*** 551: If a person is certain that Ghusl, Kafan, Salat or
burial of a dead body has been performed incorrectly, he should proceed
to do them correctly again. But if he just feels that probably the
duties were not correctly discharged, or if he has a mere doubt, then it
is not obligatory to undertake the work.

***Issue*** 552: \* The guardian of a wife is her husband. And in other
cases, men who inherit the dead person according to the categories which
will be explained later, will take precedence over each other. However,
to say that the father of the deceased takes precedence over the son,
the grandfather over the brothers, or full brothers over half-brothers
or the paternal uncles over the maternal uncles, is a ponderable issue,
and one should act with caution as the situation demands.

***Issue*** 553: \* A minor or an insane person does not qualify for
guardianship in matters related to the dead person; similarly, an absent
person who can neither attend to the duties himself, nor appoint someone
to do them, has no authority as a guardian.

***Issue*** 554: \* If a person claims that he is the guardian of the
dead person, or that the guardian of the dead person has given him
permission to carry out its Ghusl, Kafan and Dafn, or if he claims that
he is the appointed executor of the dead person in the matter of its
final rituals, his claim will be accepted, provided that he is reliable,
or that the corpse is in his possession, or that two Adils testify to
his statement.

***Issue*** 555: \* If a dead person appoints someone other than his
guardian to carry out his Ghusl, Kafan, Dafn and Salat, then he will be
the rightful person to fulfil those obligations. And it is not necessary
that the person whom the deceased has appointed to carry out the duties
personally should accept the will. However, if he accepts it he should
act accordingly.

### The Method of Ghusl of Mayyit

###

***Issue*** 556: It is obligatory to give three Ghusls to a dead body.
The first bathing should be with water mixed with “Sidr” (Beri) leaves.
The second bathing should be with water mixed with camphor and the third
should be with unmixed water.

***Issue*** 557: The quality of “Sidr” leaves and camphor should neither
be so much that the water becomes mixed (Mudhaaf), nor so little that it
may be said that “Sidr” leaves and camphor have not been mixed in it at
all.

***Issue*** 558: If enough quantity of “Sidr” leaves and camphor is not
available, then whatever quantity available should be mixed with water.

***Issue*** 559: \* If a person dies while he is in the state of Ihram
his dead body should not be washed with water mixed with camphor.
Instead of that, pure unmixed water should be used. However, in the
following two situations, water with camphor should be used:

(i) If he or she dies in Hajj Tamattu' after completing Saee';

(ii) and if it is Hajj Qiran or Ifrad, he died after having shaved the
head

***Issue*** 560: \* If “Sidr” leaves and camphor or either of these
things is not available or its use is not lawful (e.g. if it has been
usurped) the dead body should be given Ghusl, on the basis of
precaution, with pure, unmixed water instead of the Ghusl which is not
possible, and it should also be given one tayammum.

***Issue*** 561: \* A person who gives Ghusl to a dead body should be a
Muslim, preferably a Shia Ithna Asheri, adult, and sane, and should know
the rules of Ghusl. And if an intelligent, discerning boy or girl, who
is not yet baligh, gives Ghusl correctly, it will be sufficient. And if
the deceased belongs to a sect other than Shia Ithna Asheri, and if he
or she is given Ghusl according to the rules of his or her sect by a
person of his or her sect, then the Shia Ithna Asheri momin will be
relieved of the responsibility, except if he is the guardian.

***Issue*** 562: \* One who gives Ghusl to the dead body should perform
the act with the niyyat of Qurbat, that is, obedience to the pleasure of
Allah.

***Issue*** 563: \* Ghusl to a Muslim child, even illegitimate, is
obligatory. But the Ghusl, Kafan, Dafan of a non-Muslim and his children
is not allowed. And it is necessary to give Ghusl to a Muslim who has
been insane since childhood and has grown up without having recovered.

***Issue*** 564:\* If a foetus of 4 months or more is still-born it is
obligatory to give it Ghusl, and even if it has not completed four
months, but it has formed features of a human child, it must be given
Ghusl, as a precaution. In the event of both of these circumstances
being absent, the foetus will be wrapped up in a cloth and buried
without Ghusl.

***Issue*** 565: \* It is unlawful for a man to give Ghusl to the dead
body of a woman and for a woman to give Ghusl to the dead body of a man.
Husband and wife can, however, give Ghusl to the dead body of each
other, although the recommended precaution is that they should also
avoid doing so, in normal circumstances.

***Issue*** 566:\* A man can give Ghusl to the dead body of a little
girl and similarly a woman can give Ghusl to the dead body of a little
boy.

***Issue*** 567: \* If no man is available to give Ghusl to the dead
body of a man, his kinswomen who are also his mahram (one with whom
marriage is prohibited e.g., mother, sister, paternal aunt and maternal
aunt) or those women who become his mahram by way of marriage or
suckling can give Ghusl to his dead body. Similarly if no woman is
available to give Ghusl to the dead body of a woman her kinsmen who are
also her mahram or have

become mahram by marriage or suckling can give Ghusl to her dead body.
In either case, it is not obligatory to cover the body except the
private parts; though doing so is preferred.

***Issue*** 568: \* If a man gives Ghusl to the dead body of a man, or a
woman to the dead body of a woman, it is permissible to keep the body
bare, except the private parts. But it is better to give Ghusl from
under the dress.

***Issue*** 569: It is haraam to look at the private parts of a corpse
and if a person giving Ghusl looks at them, he commits a sin, though the
Ghusl will not be void.

***Issue*** 570: \* If there is AYN Najasat on any part of the dead
body, it is obligatory to first remove it before giving Ghusl. And it is
preferred that before the corpse is given Ghusl, it should be clean and
free from all other najasat.

***Issue*** 571: Ghusl for a dead body is similar to Ghusl of Janabat.
And the obligatory precaution is that a corpse should not be given Ghusl
by Irtimasi, that is, immersion, as long as it is possible to give Ghusl
by way of Tartibi. And even in the case of Tartibi Ghusl it is necessary
that the body should be washed on the right side first, and then the
left side. And the recommended precaution is that, if possible, none of
the three parts of the body be immersed in the water. Instead water
should be poured on the dead body.

***Issue*** 572: If someone dies in the state of Hayz or Janabat it is
not necessary to give him/her their respective Ghusls. The Ghusls given
to the dead body will suffice.

***Issue*** 573: \* As a precaution, it is haraam to charge any fee for
giving Ghusl to the dead. And if someone gives Ghusl with an intention
of earning and without the Niyyat of Qurbat, then the Ghusl will be
void. However, it is not unlawful to charge for the preliminary
preparations before Ghusl.

***Issue*** 574: \* There is no rule for Jabirah in Ghusl of Mayyit, so
if water is not available or there is some other valid excuse for
abstaining from using water for the Ghusl, then the dead body should be
given one tayammum instead of Ghusl. As a recommended precaution, three
tayammums may be given, and in one of the tayammum, there should be a
Niyyat of “ma-fizzimmah”. This means that a person giving tayammum
resolves that this tayammum is given to absolve him of his
responsibility.

***Issue*** 575: A person giving tayammum to the dead body should strike
his own palms on earth and then wipe them on the face and back of the
hands of the dead body. And the obligatory precaution is that he should,
if possible, use the hands of the dead for its tayammum.

### Rules Regarding Kafan

###

***Issue*** 576: The body of a dead Muslim should be given Kafan with
three pieces of cloth: a loin cloth, a shirt or tunic, and a full cover.

***Issue*** 577: \* As a precaution, the loin cloth should be long
enough to cover the body from the navel up to the knees, better still if
it covers the body from the chest up to the feet. As a precaution, the
shirt should be long enough to cover the entire body from the top of the
shoulders up to the middle of the calf, and better still if it reaches
the feet. As a precaution, the sheet cover should be long enough to
conceal the whole body, so that both

its ends could be tied. It's breadth should be enough to allow one side
to overlap the other.

***Issue*** 578: The wajib portion of the loin cloth is that which
covers from navel up to the knees and wajib portion of a shirt is that
which covers from the shoulders up to the middle of the calf of the
legs. Whatever has been mentioned over and above this is the*Mustahab*
part of the Kafan.

***Issue*** 579:\* The*Wajib* quantity of Kafan mentioned in the above
rule should be financed from the estate of the deceased, and a
reasonable quantity to cover the*Mustahab* may also be charged to the
estate, if the status of the deceased demands. But as a recommended
precaution, the*Mustahab* parts of Kafan should not be charged to the
shares of minor heirs.

***Issue*** 580: If a person makes a will that the*Mustahab* quantity of
the Kafan(as mentioned in the two foregoing rules) should be paid for
from the 1/3 of his/her estate, or if he/she has made a will that 1/3 of
the estate should be spent for himself or herself but has not specified
the type of its expenditure, or has specified it for only a part of it,
then the*Mustahab* quantity of Kafan can be taken from 1/3 of the
estate.

***Issue*** 581: \* If the deceased has not made a will that Kafan may
be paid for from the 1/3 of his estate and if they wish to take it from
the estate, they must not draw more than what has been indicated in rule
no. 579. And if they procured a Kafan which is unusually expensive, then
the extra amount paid for it should not be charged to the estate.
However, if his baligh heirs agree to pay from their shares of
inheritance, then the sum can be deducted to the extent agreed.

***Issue*** 582: The Kafan of a wife is the responsibility of her
husband even if she owns her own wealth. Similarly, if a woman is given
a revocable divorce and she dies before the expiry of her iddah, her
husband should provide her Kafan. And if her husband is not adult or is
insane, the guardian of the husband should provide Kafan for the wife
from his property.

***Issue*** 583: It is not obligatory for the relatives of deceased to
provide his Kafan even if they were his dependents during his life time.

***Issue*** 584: \* As a precaution, it must be ensured that each of the
three pieces used for Kafan is not so thin as to show the body of the
deceased. However, if the body is fully concealed when all the three
pieces are put together, then it will suffice.

***Issue*** 585: \* Kafan for a dead person must not be a usurped one,
that is, unlawfully appropriated. If nothing else but the usurped Kafan
is available, then the body will be buried without Kafan. In fact, the
usurped Kafan should be removed even if the body has already been
buried, except in some special situations, which cannot be discussed
here.

***Issue*** 586: \* It is not permissible to give a Kafan which is
najis, or which is made of pure silk, or which is woven with gold,
except in the situation of helplessness, when no alternative is to be
found.

***Issue*** 587: It is not permissible to give Kafan made of hide or
skin of a dead Najis animal, in normal circumstances. In fact, even the
skin of a dead Clean (*tahir/pak* ) animal, or Kafan made of wool or fur
from the animal whose meat is haraam to eat should not be used in normal
circumstances. (By the term 'dead' is meant an animal who has not been
slaughtered

according to Shariah). But Kafan made of wool, fur or skin of a
slaughtered halal animal can be used for the purpose. However, it is a
recommended precaution to avoid them.

***Issue*** 588: If the Kafan becomes Najis owing to its own najasat, or
owing to some other najasat, and if the Kafan is not lost totally, its
najis part should be washed or cut off, even after the dead body has
been placed in the grave. And if it is not possible to wash it, or to
cut it off, but it is possible to change it, then it should be changed.

***Issue*** 589: If a person who is wearing Ihram for Hajj or Umra dies,
he should be given Kafan like all others and there is no harm in
covering his head and face.

***Issue*** 590: It is*Mustahab* that one keeps one's Kafan and “Sidr”
leaves and camphor ready during lifetime.

### Rules of Hunut

###

***Issue*** 591: \* After having given Ghusl to a dead body it is wajib
to give Hunut, which is to apply camphor on its forehead, both the
palms, both the knees and both the big toes of its feet. It is not
necessary to rub the camphor; it must be seen on those parts. It
is*Mustahab* to apply camphor to the nose tip also. Camphor must be
powdered and fresh, and if it is so stale that it has lost its
fragrance, then it will not suffice.

***Issue*** 592: \* The recommended precaution is that camphor should
first be applied on the forehead of the deceased. It is not necessary to
observe sequence while applying camphor to other parts mentioned above.

***Issue*** 593: It is better that Hunut is given before Kafan, although
there is no harm in giving Hunut during Kafan or even after.

***Issue*** 594: \* It is not permissible to administer Hunut to a
person who died in the state of Ihram for Umra and Hajj, except in
circumstances explained in rule no. 559.

***Issue*** 595: Though it is haraam for a woman to perfume herself if
her husband has died and she is in iddah, but if she dies in iddah, it
is obligatory to give her Hunut.

***Issue*** 596: \* As a recommended precaution, perfumes like musk,
ambergris and aloes-wood ('Ud) should not be applied to the dead body,
and these things should not be mixed with camphor.

***Issue*** 597: It is*Mustahab* to mix a small quantity of Turbat (soil
of the land around the shrine of Imam Husayn) with camphor, but it
should not be applied to those parts of the body, where its use may
imply any disrespect. It is also necessary that the quantity of Turbat
is not much, so that the identity of camphor does not change.

***Issue*** 598: \* If camphor is not available or the quantity
available is just sufficient for Ghusl only, then it is not wajib to
apply Hunut. And if it is in excess of the requirement for Ghusl but is
not sufficient for administering Hunut to all the parts, then as a
recommended precaution, camphor will be applied on the forehead of the
dead body first and the remainder, if any, will be applied to other
parts.

***Issue*** 599: It is also*Mustahab* that 2 pieces of fresh and green
twigs are placed in the grave with the dead body.

### Rules of Salat al-Mayyit

###

***Issue*** 600: It is obligatory to offer Salat al-Mayyit for every
Muslim, as well as for a Muslim child if it has completed 6 years of its
age.

***Issue*** 601: \* If a child had not completed 6 years of its age, but
it was a discerning child who knew what Salat was, then as an obligatory
precaution, Salat al-Mayyit for it should be offered. If it did not know
of Salat, then the prayers may be offered with the Niyyat of 'Raja'.
However, to offer Salat al-Mayyit for a still born child is
not*Mustahab* .

***Issue*** 602: Salat al-Mayyit should be offered after the dead body
has been given Ghusl, Hunnut and Kafan and if it is offered before or
during the performance of these acts, it does not suffice, even if it is
due to forgetfulness or on account of not knowing the rule.

***Issue*** 603: It is not necessary for a person who offers Salat
al-Mayyit to be in Wudhu or Ghusl or tayammum nor is it necessary that
his body and dress be Clean (*tahir/pak* ). Rather there is no harm even
if his dress is a usurped one. However, it is better that while offering
this Salat one should observe all the formal rules which are normally
observed in other prayers.

***Issue*** 604: One who offers Salat al-Mayyit should face the Qibla,
and it is also obligatory that at the time of Salat al-Mayyit, the dead
body remains before him on its back, in a manner that its head is on his
right and its feet on his left side.

***Issue*** 605: \* As a recommended precaution, the place where a man
stands to offer Salat al-Mayyit should not be a usurped one, and it
should not be higher or lower than the place where the dead body is
kept. However, its being a little higher or lower is immaterial.

***Issue*** 606: The person offering Salat al-Mayyit should not be
distant from the dead body. However, if he is praying in a congregation,
then there is no harm in his being distant from the dead body in the
rows which are connected to each other.

***Issue*** 607: In Salat al-Mayyit, one who offers prayers should stand
in such a way that the dead body is in front of him, except if the Salat
is prayed in Jama'at and the lines extend beyond on both sides, then
praying away from the dead body will not be objectionable.

***Issue*** 608: As a precaution, there should be no curtain or wall or
any other obstruction between the dead body and the person offering
Salat al-Mayyit. However, there is no harm if the dead body is in a
coffin or in any other similar thing.

***Issue*** 609: \* The private parts of the dead body should be
concealed when Salat al-Mayyit is being offered. And if it was not
possible to give Kafan, even then at least its private parts should be
covered with a board or brick or any similar thing.

***Issue*** 610: A person should be standing while offering Salat
al-Mayyit and should offer it with the Niyyat of Qurbat, specifying the
dead person for whom he is praying. For example, he should make his
intention thus: “I am offering Salat for this dead person in compliance
with the pleasure of Allah”.

***Issue*** 611: If there is no one who is capable of praying Salat
al-Mayyit while standing, then it can be offered while sitting.

***Issue*** 612: If the deceased had made a will that a particular
person should lead the prayers for him the recommended precaution is
that such a person should take permission from the guardian of the dead
person.

***Issue*** 613: It is Makrooh to repeat Salat al-Mayyit a number of
times, unless the dead person was an Aalim and pious one, in which case
it is not Makrooh.

***Issue*** 614: \* If a dead body is buried without Salat al-Mayyit,
either intentionally or forgetfully, on account of an excuse, or if it
transpires after its burial that the prayers offered for it was void, it
will not be permissible to dig up the grave for praying Salat al-Mayyit.
There is no objection to praying, with the Niyyat of Raja', by the
graveside, if one feels that the decay has not yet taken place.

### Method of Salat al-Mayyit

###

***Issue*** 615: There are 5 takbirs (saying*Allahu Akbar* ) in*Salat
al-Mayyit* and it is sufficient if a person recites those 5 takbirs in
the following order:

***• After making Niyyat*** to offer the prayers and pronouncing
the***1st takbir*** he should say:*Ash hadu an la ilaha illal lah wa
ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah.* (I bear witness that there is no
god but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger).

***• After the 2nd takbir*** he should say:*Alla humma salli 'ala
Muhammadin wa 'ali Muhammad.* (O' Lord! Bestow peace and blessing upon
Muhammad and his progeny).

•***After the 3rd takbir*** he should say:*Alla hummaghfir lil mu'minina
wal mu'minat* .(O' Lord! Forgive all believers - men as well as women).

***• After the 4th takbir*** he should say:*Alla hummaghfir li hazal
mayyit* . (O' Lord! Forgive this dead body). If the dead person is a
woman, he would say: Alla hummaghfir li hazihil mayyit.

***Thereafter he should pronounce the 5th takbir.***

It is, however, better that he should pronounce the following
supplications after the takbirs respectively:

***After the 1st takbir:*** *Ash hadu an la ilaha illallahu wahdahu la
sharika lah. Wa Ashhadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa Rasuluh, arsalahu bil
haqqi bashiran wa naziran bayna yada yis sa'ah* .

***After the 2nd takbir:*** *Alla humma salli 'ala Muhammadin wa Ali
Muhammad wa barik 'ala Muhammadin wa Ali Muhammad warham Muhammadan wa
Ala Muhammadin ka afzali ma sallayta wa barakta wa tarah hamta 'ala
Ibrahima wa Ali Ibrahima innaka Hamidum Majid wa salli 'ala jami'il
ambiya'iwal-mursalina wash-shuhada'i was-siddiqina wa jami'i 'ibadilla
his-salihin.*

***After the 3rd takbir:*** *Alla hum maghfir lil mu'minina wal
mu'minati wal muslimina wal muslimat, al ahya'i minhum wal amwat
tabi'baynana wa baynahum bil khayrati innaka mujibud-da'wat innak 'ala
kulli shay'in Qadeer.*

***After the 4th takbir:*** *Alla humma inna haza 'abduka wabnu 'abdika
wabnu amatika nazala bika wa anta khayru manzulin bihi Alla humma inna
la na'lamu minhu illa khayra wa anta a'alamu bihi minna. Alla humma in
kana mohsinan fa zid fi ihsanihi wa in kana musi'an fatajawaz anhu
waghfir*

*lahu. Alla hummaj'alhu 'indaka fi a'la'illiyyin wakhluf 'ala ahlihi fil
ghabirin warhamhu bi-rahmatika ya ar hamar Rahimin.*

If the dead body is that of a woman he should say:*Alla humma inna
hazihi 'amatuka wabnatu 'abdika wabnatu amatika nazalat bika wa anta
khayra manzulin bihi Alla humma inna la na'lamu minha illa khayra wa
anta a'lamu biha minna. Alla humma in kanat mohsinatan fa zid fi
ihsaniha wa in kanat musi'atan fatajawaz 'anha waghfir laha. Alla
hummaj'al ha 'indaka fi a'la 'illiyin wakhluf 'ala ahliha fil ghabirin
warhamha bi-rahmatika ya ar hamar Rahimin.* Thereafter he should
pronounce the 5th takbir.

***Issue*** 616: A person offering prayers for the dead body should
recite takbirs and supplications in a sequence, so that Salat al-Mayyit
does not lose its form.

***Issue*** 617: A person who joins Salat al-Mayyit to follow an Imam
should recite all the takbirs and supplications.

### Mustahab Acts of Salat al-Mayyit

###

***Issue*** 618: The following acts are*Mustahab* in the prayers for the
dead body:

• A person who offers prayers for the dead body should have had Ghusl or
performed Wudhu or tayammum. And the precaution is that he should
perform tayammum only when it is not possible to do Ghusl, or Wudhu, or
if he fears that if he goes for Ghusl or Wudhu it will not be possible
for him to participate in the prayers.

• If the dead body is that of a male the Imam or a person who is
offering the prayers alone should stand at the centre of its height,
that is, the middle part of the dead body, and if the dead body is that
of a female he should stand at the chest of the dead body.

• To pray bare-footed.

• To raise one's hands (up to the ears) while pronouncing every takbir.

• The distance between the person offering prayers and the dead body
should be so short that, when the wind blows, the dress of the person
offering the prayers would touch the coffin.

• To pray in congregation.

• The Imam to recite the takbirs and supplications loudly and those
offering the prayers with him to recite them in a low voice.

• If there is only one person joining the Salat al-Mayyit being offered
in Jama'at, he would stand behind the Imam.

• One who offers the prayers should earnestly and persistently pray for
the dead as well as for all the believers.

• Before the commencement of the congregational prayers for the dead
body one should say “as-Salat” three times.

• The prayers be offered at a place where people often go for Salat
al-Mayyit.

• If a Haaez (woman in her menses) participates in the congregational
prayers for a dead person, she should stand alone and should not join
the lines.

***Issue*** 619: It is Makrooh to perform prayers for dead bodies in
masjids, except in Masjidul Haram.

### Rules About Burial of the Dead Body

###

***Issue*** 620: \* It is obligatory to bury a dead body in the ground,
so deep that its smell does not come out and the beasts of prey do not
dig it out, and, if there is a danger of such beasts digging it out then
the grave should be made solid with bricks, etc.

***Issue*** 621: If it is not possible to bury a dead body in the
ground, it may be kept in a vault or a coffin, instead.

***Issue*** 622: The dead body should be laid in the grave on its right
side so that the face remains towards the Qibla.

***Issue*** 623: \* If a person dies on a ship and if there is no fear
of the decay of the dead body and if there is no problem in retaining it
for sometime on the ship, it should be kept on it and buried in the
ground after reaching the land. Otherwise, after giving Ghusl, Hunut,
Kafan and Salat al-Mayyit it should be lowered into the sea in a vessel
of clay or with a weight tied to its feet. And as far as possible it
should not be lowered at a point where it is eaten up immediately by the
sea predators.

***Issue*** 624: If it is feared that an enemy may dig up the grave and
exhume the dead body and amputate its ears or nose or other limbs, it
should be lowered into sea, if possible, as stated in the foregoing
rule.

***Issue*** 625: \* The expenses of lowering the dead body into the sea,
or making the grave solid on the ground can be deducted from the estate
of the deceased, if necessary.

***Issue*** 626: \* If a non-Muslim woman dies with a dead child, or
soulless foetus in her womb, and if the father is a Muslim then the
woman should be laid in the grave on her left side with her back towards
Qibla, so that the face of the child is towards Qibla.

***Issue*** 627: It is not permitted to bury a Muslim in the graveyard
of the non-Muslims, nor to bury a non-Muslim in the graveyard of the
Muslims.

***Issue*** 628: It is also not permissible to bury the dead body of a
Muslim at a place which is disrespectful, like places where garbage is
thrown.

***Issue*** 629: It is not permissible to bury a dead body in a usurped
place nor in a place which is dedicated for purposes other than burial
(e.g. in a Masjid).

***Issue*** 630: \* It is not permissible to dig up a grave for the
purpose of burying another dead body in it, unless one is sure that the
grave is very old and the former body has been totally disintegrated.

***Issue*** 631: \* Anything which is separated from the dead body (even
its hair, nail or tooth) should be buried along with it. And if any part
of the body, including hair, nails or teeth are found after the body has
been buried, they should be buried at a separate place, as per
obligatory precaution. And it is*Mustahab* that nails and teeth cut off
or extracted during lifetime are also buried.

***Issue*** 632: If a person dies in a well and it is not possible to
take him out, the well should be sealed, and the well should be treated
as his grave.

***Issue*** 633: If a child dies in its mother's womb and its remaining
in the womb is dangerous for the mother, it should be brought out in the
easiest possible way. If it becomes inevitable to cut it into pieces
there is no objection in doing so. It is, however, better that if the
husband of the woman

is skilled in surgery the dead body of the child should be taken out by
him, and failing that, the job should be performed by a skilled woman.
And if that is not available, a skilled surgeon who is the mahram (one
with whom marriage cannot be contracted) of the woman should do it. And
if even that is not available a skilled man who is not mahram (one with
whom marriage can be contracted) should remove the dead child. And if
even such a person is not available the dead body can be brought out by
any unskilled person.

***Issue*** 634: If a woman dies and there is a living child in her
womb, it should be brought out in the safest possible way, even if there
be no hope for the child's survival. The body of the mother should then
be sewn up.

#### Mustahab Acts of Dafn

***Issue*** 635: It is*Mustahab* that the depth of the grave should be
approximately equal to the size of an average person and the dead body
be buried in the nearest graveyard, except when the graveyard which is
situated farther is better due to some reasons, like if pious persons
are buried there or people go there in large number for Fateha.

It is also recommended that the coffin is placed on the ground a few
yards away from the grave and then taken to the grave by halting three
times briefly. It should be placed on the ground every time and then
lifted before finally it is lowered into the grave at the 4th time. And
if the dead body is of a male, it should be placed on the ground at the
3rd time in such a manner that its head should be towards the lower side
of the grave and at the 4th time it should be lowered into the grave
from the side of its head. And if the dead body is of a female it should
be placed on the ground at the 3rd time towards the Qibla and should be
lowered into the grave sidewise and a cloth should be spread over the
grave while lowering it.

It is also*Mustahab* that the dead body should be taken out of the
coffin and lowered into the grave very gently, and the prescribed
supplications should be recited before and during burying the dead body;
and after the dead body has been lowered into the niche, the ties of its
shroud should be unfastened and its cheek should be placed on earth, and
an earthen pillow should be done up under its head and some unbacked
bricks or lumps of clay should be placed behind its back so that the
dead body may not return flat on its back. Before closing the niche, the
person reciting the talqin should hold with his right hand the right
shoulder of the dead body and should place his left hand tightly on its
left shoulder and take his mouth near its ear and shaking its shoulders
should say thrice: Isma' ifham ya.......here the name of the dead person
and his father should be called. For example, if the name of the dead
person is Muhammad and his father's name 'Ali it should be said thrice:
Isma 'ifham ya Muhammad bin 'Ali.

And then he should say:

*Hal anta 'alal 'ahdil lazi farqtana 'alayhi min shahadati an la ilaha
illal lahu wahdahu la sharika lah wa anna Muhammadan sallal lahu 'alayhi
wa Alihi 'abduhu wa Rasuluhu wa sayyidun nabiyyina wa khatamul mursalina

hujajullahi'alal khalqi ajma'ina wa a'immatuka a'immatu hudan abrar
ya........* (here the name of the dead person and his father should be
called)

And then the following words should be said:*Iza atakal malakanil

Rabbika wa 'an Nabiyyika wa 'an dinika wa 'an Kitabika wa 'an Qiblatika

Here the name of the dead person and his father should be called and
thereafter it should be said:

*Annal laha tabaraka wa ta'ala ni'mar-Rabb wa anna Muhammadan sallal
lahu 'alayhi wa Alihi ni'mar Rasul wa anna 'Aliyyabna Abi Talib wa
awladahul ma'suminal A'i'mmatal ithna 'asharah ni'mal A'i'mmah wa anna

tatayiral kutubi haqqun wa annal jannata haqqun wan-nara haqqun wa annas
sa'ata a'tiyatun la rayba fiha wa annallaha yab'athu man fil qubur.*

Then the following words should be said:*Afahimta ya....* (here the name
of the dead person should be called) and thereafter the following should
be said:*Thabbatakallahu bil qawlith thabit wa hadakallahu ila siratim
mustaqim 'arrafallahu baynaka wa bayna awliya'ika fi mustaqarrim min
rahmatih. Then the following words should be uttered: Alla humma jafil
arza 'an jambayhi vas'ad biruhihi ilayka wa laqqihi minka burhana Alla
humma 'afwaka 'afwaka.*

***Issue*** 636: It is recommended that the person who lowers the dead
body in the grave should be Clean (*tahir/pak* ), bare-headed and
bare-footed and he should climb out of the grave from the feet side.
Moreover, persons, other than the near relatives of the deceased, should
put the dust into the grave with the back side of their hands and recite
the following:*Inna lillahi wa innailayhi raji'un* . If the dead person
is a woman, her mahram and in the absence of a mahram her kinsmen should
lower her in the grave.

***Issue*** 637: It is*Mustahab* that the grave be square or rectangular
in shape and its height equal to four fingers' span. A sign should be
fixed on it for the purpose of identification and water should be poured
on it, and then those present should place their hands on the grave
parting their fingers and

thrusting them into earth. Then recite Surah al-Qadr 7 times and pray
for the forgiveness of the departed soul and say:*Alla humma jafil arza
'an jam bayhi wa as'idilayka ruhahu wa laqqihi minka rizwana wa askin
qabrahu min rahmatika ma tughneehi bihi 'an rahmati man siwaka.*

***Issue*** 638: It is*Mustahab* that when the persons who attended the
funeral have departed, the guardian of the dead person or the person
whom the guardian grants permission should recite the prescribed
supplications for the dead person.

***Issue*** 639: It is*Mustahab* that after the burial, the bereaved
family is consoled, praying for their well being. However, if the
condolence is given long after the event, and if it serves to refresh
the sorrowful memories, then it should be avoided.

It is*Mustahab* that food be sent to the members of the family of the
deceased for 3 days. It is, however, Makrooh to take meal with them in
their homes.

***Issue*** 640: It is also*Mustahab* that a person should observe
patience on the death of his near ones, especially on the death of his
son, and, whenever the memory of the departed soul crosses his mind, he
should say: Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un and should recite the
holy Qur'an for the sake of the departed. A man should visit the graves
of his parents and pray there for the blessings of Allah for himself and
should make the grave solid so that it may not be easily ruined.

***Issue*** 641: \* As a matter of precaution, one should refrain from
scratching one's face or body, or uprooting one's hair to display the
grief. However, slapping one's head or face is permitted.

***Issue*** 642: \* It is not permissible to tear one's clothes on the
death of anyone except on the death of one's father and brother, though
the recommended precaution is that one should not tear one's clothes on
their death also.

***Issue*** 643: If a wife mourning the death of a husband scratches her
face causing blood to come out, or pulls her hair, she should, on the
basis of recommended precaution, set a slave free, or feed ten poor, or
provide them dress. And the same applies when a man tears his clothes on
the death of his wife or son.

***Issue*** 644: \* The recommended precaution is that while weeping
over the death of any person one's voice should not be very loud.

Salat al-Wahshat (Prayers to be offered for the departed soul on the
night of burial)

***Issue*** 645: It is befitting that on the first night after the
burial of a dead person, two Raka'ats of wahshat prayers be offered for
it. The method of offering this prayers is as follows:

In the first Raka'at, after reciting Surah al-Hamd, Ayatul Kursi should
be recited once and in the second Raka'at, Surah al-Qadr should be
recited 10 times after Surah-al-Hamd; and after saying the Salam the
following supplication should be recited: Alla humma salli 'ala
Muhammadin wa Ali Muhammad wab'ath thawabaha ila qabri......(here the
name of the dead person and his father's name should be mentioned).

***Issue*** 646: Wahshat prayers can be offered in the night following
the burial of the dead body at any time, but it is better to offer it in
the early hours of the night after 'Isha prayers.

***Issue*** 647: \* If it is proposed to transfer the dead body to some
other town or its burial is delayed owing to some reason, the wahshat
prayers should be deferred till the first night of its burial.

Exhumation
----------

***Issue*** 648: It is haraam to open the grave of a Muslim even if it
belongs to a child or an insane person. However, there is no objection
in doing so if the dead body has decayed and turned into dust.

***Issue*** 649: \* Digging up or destroying the graves of the
descendants of Imams, the martyrs, the Ulama and the pious persons is
Haraam, even if they are very old, because it amounts to desecration.

***Issue*** 650: \* Digging up the grave is allowed in the following
cases:

• When the dead body has been buried in an usurped land and the owner of
the land is not willing to let it remain there.

• When the Kafan of the dead body or any other thing buried with it had
been usurped and the owner of the thing in question is not willing to
let it remain in the grave. Similarly, if anything belonging to the
heirs has been buried along with the deceased and the heirs are not
willing to let it remain in the grave. However, if the dead person had
made a will that a certain supplication or the holy Qur'an or a ring be
buried along with his dead body, and if that will is valid, then the
grave cannot be opened up to bring those articles out. There are certain
situations when the exhuming is not permitted even if the land, the
Kafan or the articles buried with the corpse are Ghasbi. But there is no
room for details here.

• When opening the grave does not amount to disrespect of the dead
person, and it transpires that he was buried without Ghusl or Kafan, or
the Ghusl was void, or he was not given Kafan according to religious
rules, or was not laid in the grave facing the Qibla.

• When it is necessary to inspect the body of the dead person to
establish a right which is more important than exhumation.

• When the dead body of a Muslim has been buried at a place which is
against sanctity, like, when it has been buried in the graveyard of
non-Muslim or at a place of garbage.

• When the grave is opened up for a legal purpose which is more
important than exhumation. For example, when it is proposed to take out
a living child from the womb of a buried woman.

• When it is feared that a wild beast would tear up the corpse or it
will be carried away by flood or exhumed by the enemy.

• When the deceased has willed that his body be transferred to sacred
places before burial, and if it was intentionally or forgetfully buried
elsewhere, then the body can be exhumed, provided that doing so does not
result in any disrespect to the deceased.

Mustahab Ghusls
---------------

***Issue*** 651: \* In Islam, several Ghusls are*Mustahab* . Some of
them are listed below:

• Ghusl al-Jumuah: Its prescribed time is from Fajr to sunset, but it is
better to perform it near Zuhr. If, however, a person does not perform
it till noon, he can perform it till dusk without a Niyyat of either
performing it on time or as Qadha. And if a person does not perform his
Ghusl on Friday it is*Mustahab* that he should perform the Qadha of
Ghusl on Saturday at any time between dawn and dusk. And if a person
knows that it will not be possible for him to procure water for his
Ghusl on Friday he can perform the Ghusl on Thursday with the Niyyat of
Raja', that is, as a desirable act. And it is*Mustahab* to recite the
following supplication while performing Friday Ghusl: 'Ash hadu an la
ilaha il lal lahu wahdahu la sharika lah wa ash hadu anna Muhammadan
'abduhu wa Rasuluh. Alla humma salli 'ala Muhammadin wa Ali Muhammad
waj'alni minat tawwabina waj'alni minal mutatahhirin. (I testify that
there is none to be worshipped but Allah alone, Who has no associate and
Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. O Allah! Bless Muhammad and his
Progeny. And make me one of those who are repentant and pure).

• Taking baths on the 1st and 17th nights and in the earlier part of the
19th, 21st, 23rd nights and 24th night of the holy month of Ramadhan.

• Ghusl on Eidul Fitr day and Eidul Azha day. The time of this Ghusl is
from Fajr up to sunset. It is, however, better to perform it before Eid
prayers.

• Ghusl on the 8th and 9th of the month of Dhul-Hijj. As regards the
bathing on the 9th of Dhul-Hijj it is better to perform it at noon-time.

• Ghusl by a person who has touched a dead body after it has been given
Ghusl.

• Ghusl for Ihram (pilgrim's dress).

• Ghusl for entry into the haram of Makkah.

• Ghusl for entry into Makkah.

• Ghusl for visiting the holy Ka'bah.

• Ghusl for entry into the holy Ka'bah.

• Ghusl for slaughtering an animal and for shaving one's head (during
pilgrimage).

• Ghusl for entry into Madinah, and its haram (sanctuary).

• Ghusl for entry into the Mosque of the holy Prophet.

• Ghusl at the time of bidding farewell to the sacred shrine of the holy
Prophet.

• Ghusl for Mubahala (imprecation) with the enemy.

• Ghusl to a new-born child.

• Ghusl for Istakhara.

• Ghusl for offering Istisqa' - invocation for rains.

***Issue*** 652: \* The Fuqaha have mentioned many more*Mustahab*
Ghusls, some of which are as follows:

• Ghusl on all odd nights of the month of Ramadhan and on each of its
last 10 nights and in the last part of its 23rd night.

• Ghusl on the 24th day of Dhul-Hijj.

• Ghusl on the day of Eid-i-Nawroz and 15th of Sha'ban and 9th and 17th
of Rabi'ul Awwal and the 25th day of Dhul-Qa'dah.

• Ghusl by a woman who has perfumed herself for someone other than her
husband.

• Ghusl by one who slept in a state of intoxication.

• Ghusl by a person who went to witness the hanging and saw the hanged
person. However, if his eyes fell on him by chance or helplessly, or if
he had gone for example, to give evidence, Ghusl will not be*Mustahab*
for him.

• Ghusl for the Ziyarat of the Masoomen (A.S.) whether from near or far.
However, as a precaution, these Ghusls should be done with the Niyyat of
'Raja', (i.e. with a hope that it might be a desirable act).

***Issue*** 653: After having taken the*Mustahab* Ghusl listed in rule
no. 651, one can perform acts (e.g. prayers) for which Wudhu is
necessary. However, Ghusl performed with the Niyyat of 'Raja' do not not
suffice for Wudhu (i.e. Wudhu has to be performed).

***Issue*** 654: If a person wishes to perform a number of*Mustahab*
Ghusls, one Ghusl with the Niyyat of performing all the Ghusls will be
sufficient.

Tayammum
--------

Tayammum should be performed instead of Wudhu or Ghusl in the following
seven circumstances:

***First:***

*When it is not possible to procure sufficient water for performing
Wudhu or Ghusl.*

***Issue*** 655: \* If a person happens to be in a populated area he
should make his best efforts to procure water for Wudhu or Ghusl till
such time that he loses all hope. And if he happens to be in a desert,
he should search for water on the way or at nearby places. And if the
land is uneven, or densely wooded, and it is difficult to walk, he
should search for water in all the four directions for a distance
covered by one or two flings of an arrow. (A fling is equal to about two
hundred steps).\*\*

***Issue*** 656: If out of the four directions, some are even and others
are uneven, one should search for water in the even direction to the
extent of two arrow flings, and on the side which is uneven to the
extent of one arrow fling.

***Issue*** 657: It is not obligatory for a person to search for water
in the direction where he is sure that water is not available.

***Issue*** 658: \* If the time left for Salat is not short, and if he
is sure or feels sure that water is available at a farther place, he
should go there to procure water, provided that going there is not
extremely difficult, and that the distance is not unusually long. And if
he has mere suspicion about water being there, then it is not necessary
for him to go.

\*\* In his commentary on the book entitled*Man la Yahzuruhul Faqih* the
late Allama Majlisi has defined the distance covered by an arrow to be
equal to 200 footsteps.

***Issue*** 659: It is not necessary that a person should go himself in
search of water. He can send a reliable person for this purpose. And it
is sufficient if one person goes on behalf of many.

***Issue*** 660: \* If a person feels that there might be some water in
the provision he carries or at the place of encampment or even in the
convoy, he should search for it thoroughly, till he is satisfied that
there is no water or he becomes hopeless.

***Issue*** 661: If a person searched for water before the time for
Salat, but did not find it and if he stayed there till the time of
prayers set in, he should search for water again, as a recommended
precaution, provided he feels that water may be found.

***Issue*** 662: If a person searched for water after the time for Salat
had set in, and did not find it, if he stayed there till the time for
next prayers, and if he felt there was a possibility of water being
found, the recommended precaution is that he should go in search of
water again.

***Issue*** 663: When the time left for prayers is short or when there
is fear of thieves or wild beasts or when the search for water is
unbearable, it is not necessary for one to search for water.

***Issue*** 664: \* If a person does not search for water till the time
for Salat approaches Qadha, in spite of the fact that he would have
found water if he

had tried, such a person has committed a sin, but the Salat which he
will pray with tayammum will be valid.

***Issue*** 665: \* If a person is sure that he cannot get water and
does not, therefore, go in search of water and offers his prayers with
tayammum, but realises after prayers that if he had made an effort he
would have fetched water, he should, as an obligatory precaution, do
wudhu and repeat the prayers.

***Issue*** 666: \* If a person could not get water after a search and
prayed with tayammum and then learns later after offering prayers that
water was available at the place where he had searched, his prayers is
valid.

***Issue*** 667: If a person believed that the time left for prayers was
little, and prayed with tayammum without going in search of water, but
later learnt after the prayers but before the expiry of time that there
was time for a search of water, then the obligatory precaution is that
he should repeat that prayer.

***Issue*** 668: \* If the time for Salat has set in and a person is
already with Wudhu, he should not allow his Wudhu to become void if he
knows that he will not be able to find water or he will not be able to
do Wudhu again. As an obligatory precaution, he should not invalidate
his Wudhu deliberately. However, a man can have sex with his wife even
if he knows that he will not be able to do Ghusl.

***Issue*** 669: \* Similarly, if a person is with Wudhu before the time
for prayers set in, and knew that if he made his Wudhu void, it would
not be possible for him to get water, the recommended precaution is that
he should try to keep his Wudhu intact. As an obligatory precaution, he
should not invalidate the Wudhu deliberately.

***Issue*** 670: If a person has just sufficient water for Wudhu or for
Ghusl, and if he knows that if he spills it he will not be able to get
water again, it is haraam for him to spill it if the time for prayers
has already set in, and the obligatory precaution is that he should not
throw it away even before the time for prayers sets in.

***Issue*** 671: \* If a person knew that he would not get water, and
yet made his Wudhu void or spilled it after the time for prayers had set
in, he committed a sin but his prayers with tayammum will be order.
However, the recommended precaution is that he should offer the Qadha of
the prayers.

***Second:***

***Issue*** 672: \* If a person is unable to procure water on account of
old age or weakness, or fear of a thief or a beast, or because he does
not possess means to draw water from a well, he should perform tayammum.
The same would apply if acquiring water is intolerably difficult. But in
this last situation, if a person, inspite of the difficulty, did not
perform tayammum, and did Wudhu, his Wudhu will be valid.

***Issue*** 673: If a bucket, a rope and other similar implements are
needed for pulling water out of a well, and the person concerned is
obliged to purchase or hire them, he should do so even if he has to pay
much more than the usual rate. Similarly, he has to buy the water even
if it is sold at a higher price. However, if by doing so, his economic
condition is harmed, then it is not obligatory to procure them.

***Issue*** 674: If a person is obliged to take a loan for procuring
water he should take a loan. However, if he knows or feels that it will
not be possible for him to repay the loan it is not obligatory for him
to take a loan.

***Issue*** 675: If digging a well does not involve much hardship the
person concerned should dig a well to get water.

***Issue*** 676: If he is given water by another person without any
obligation he should accept it.

***Third:***

***Issue*** 677: If a person fears that if he uses water his life will
be endangered, or he will suffer from some ailment or physical defect,
or the illness from which he is already suffering will be prolonged, or
become acute or some complications may arise in its treatment, he should
perform tayammum. However, if he can avoid the harm by using warm water,
he should prepare warm water and do Wudhu, or Ghusl when it is
necessary.

***Issue*** 678: It is not necessary to be absolutely certain that water
is harmful to him. If he feels that there is a probability of harm, and
if that probability is justified by popular opinion, giving cause for
some fear, then he should do tayammum.

***Issue*** 679: If a person has an eye disease and water is harmful to
him he should perform tayammum.

***Issue*** 680: If a person performs tayammum on account of certainty
or fear about water being harmful to him but realises before Salat that
it is not harmful, his tayammum is void. And if he realises this after
having prayed he should offer the prayers again with Wudhu or Ghusl.

***Issue*** 681: If a person was sure that water was not harmful to him,
and he did Ghusl or Wudhu, but later realised that water was harmful to
him, his wudhu and Ghusl will be void.

***Fourth:***

***Issue*** 682: \* If a person fears that if he uses water for Ghusl or
Wudhu, he will be involved in hardship because of thirst, he should
perform tayammum. Tayammum is permissible in the following three cases:

• If he fears that by using up the water for Ghusl or Wudhu he will
suffer an acute thirst, which may result in his illness or death, or it
may cause intolerable hardship.

• If he fears that his dependents whose protection is his
responsibility, may become ill or die due to thirst.

• If he fears that others, human beings or animals, may die or suffer
some illness or become unbearably restless and distressed due to lack of
water.

Apart from these three conditions mentioned, it is not permissible to
perform tayammum when water is available.

***Issue*** 683: \* If besides the Clean (*tahir/pak* ) water which a
person has for Wudhu or Ghusl he also has najis water enough for
drinking, he should keep the Clean (*tahir/pak* ) water for drinking and
pray with tayammum. When water is required for other people attached to
him, he would keep Clean (*tahir/pak* ) water for Wudhu and Ghusl and
let them quench their thirst with najis water, regardless of whether
they know about the najasat or not, or whether they care about it or
not. If water is required for an animal or a

minor child, it should be given najis water to drink and Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) water be used for Wudhu or Ghusl.

***Fifth:***

***Issue*** 684: \* If the body or dress of a person is najis and he
possesses only as much water as is likely to be exhausted if he does
Ghusl or Wudhu, and no water would be available for making his body or
dress Clean (*tahir/pak* ), he should make is body or dress Clean
(*tahir/pak* ) and pray Salat with tayammum. But if he does not have
anything upon which he would do tayammum, then he should use the water
for Ghusl and Wudhu, and pray with najis body or dress.

***Sixth:***

***Issue*** 685: If a person possesses such water or container which is
not permitted to use, like when they are usurped (Ghasbi) he should
perform tayammum instead of Ghusl and Wudhu.

***Seventh:***

***Issue*** 686: When the time left for Salat is so little that if a
person does Ghusl or Wudhu he would be obliged to offer the entire
prayers or a part of it after the prescribed time, he should perform
tayammum.

***Issue*** 687: If a person intentionally delays offering the prayers
till no time is left for Ghusl or Wudhu, he commits a sin, but the
prayers offered by him with tayammum will be valid, although recommended
precaution is that he should give Qadha of the prayers.

***Issue*** 688: If a person doubts whether any time will be left for
prayers if he does Ghusl or Wudhu, he should perform tayammum.

***Issue*** 689: If a person performs tayammum owing to shortage of time
and after the Salat he had an opportunity to do Wudhu but did not do so
till the water he had is no longer with him, he will have to perform a
new tayammum for subsequent prayers, even if the first tayammum had not
become void, provided, of course, that tayammum continues to be his
religious obligation.

***Issue*** 690: \* If a person has water, but because of shortage of
time he prays with tayammum and while in prayers, the water he had goes
out of his possession, he will, as per recommended precaution, do
tayammum again for the subsequent prayers, provided that his religious
obligation continues to be tayammum.

***Issue*** 691: If a person has only just enough time that he may
perform Wudhu or Ghusl and offer prayers without its*Mustahab* acts like
Iqamah and Qunut, he should do Ghusl or Wudhu, whichever is then
necessary, and pray without those*Mustahab* parts. In fact, if for that
purpose, he has to avoid the next Sura after al-Hamd, he should do so
after doing Wudhu or Ghusl.

### Things on which Tayammum is Allowed

###

***Issue*** 692: Tayammum can be done on earth, sand, lump of clay or
stone but the recommended precaution is that if earth is available
tayammum should not be performed on anything else. If earth is not
available, then it can be performed on sand or a lump of clay, and in
absence of these on a stone.

***Issue*** 693: \* Tayammum can also be done on gypsum or lime-stone.
Similarly, tayammum is allowed on dust which gathers on the dress or the
carpets etc., provided that its quantity is such that it can be termed
as soft earth. However, it is a recommended precaution, that using dust
be avoided if other alternatives are available. It is also a recommended
precaution that baked gypsum, lime, brick and mineral stones be avoided.

***Issue*** 694: \* If a person cannot find earth, sand, lump of clay or
stone, he should perform tayammum on mud, and if even that is not
available, then on dust particles which settle on the carpets or the
dresses, though it may not be in a quantity which could be considered as
soft earth. And if none of these things is available he should, on the
basis of recommended precaution, pray without tayammum, but it will be
obligatory for him to repeat the prayers later as Qadha.

***Issue*** 695: \* If a person can gather some earth by shaking the
carpet etc. then to do tayammum with dust particles will not be correct.
And similarly if he can make mud dry and obtain earth from it, then
tayammum on wet mud will be incorrect and void.

***Issue*** 696: If a person does not have water, but has snow or ice he
should, if possible, melt it into water and perform Wudhu and Ghusl. And
if it is not possible to do so and also he does not have anything on
which tayammum is allowed then it is necessary that he should give Qadha
after Salat time. But it is better that he should make the parts of
Wudhu or Ghusl wet with snow or ice. And if even this is not possible he
should perform tayammum on snow or ice and offer prayers in time.

***Issue*** 697: If a thing like straw, on which tayammum is void, gets
mixed with clay and sand, then tayammum cannot be performed on it.
However, if it is so little that it gets lost in the sand or clay, then
tayammum with it is valid.

***Issue*** 698: If a person does not own anything on which to perform
tayammum he should, if possible, get it by purchasing or other similar
means.

***Issue*** 699: Performing tayammum on mud wall is valid but the
recommended precaution is that if dry earth or clay is available,
tayammum should not be performed on wet earth or mud.

***Issue*** 700: The thing on which a person performs tayammum should be
Clean (*tahir/pak* ) and, if he has no Clean (*tahir/pak* ) thing on
which tayammum would be correct, it is not obligatory for him to offer
prayers. He should, however, give its Qadha, though it is better that he
should pray within the prescribed time.

***Issue*** 701: If a person was sure that tayammum on a particular
thing was valid and he did it accordingly, but came to know later that
tayammum performed was void, he would repeat the prayers performed with
that tayammum.

***Issue*** 702: \* The thing used for tayammum should not have been
usurped, or obtained without the owner's permission. Tayammum on usurped
objects like earth, etc, will be void.

***Issue*** 703: \* Tayammum performed in usurped area or space is not
void. Hence, if a person strikes his hands on the earth for tayammum in
his own

property, and then enters the property of another person without
obtaining permission to wipe his hands on his forehead, his tayammum is
correct and valid, though he has committed a sin (by trespassing).

***Issue*** 704: \* If someone does tayammum on a usurped object,
forgetfully or by way of negligence, his tayammum will be valid.
However, if a person himself usurps something, and then forgets that he
has usurped it, then tayammum performed on such a thing cannot be
considered as valid.

***Issue*** 705: \* If a person is imprisoned in a usurped place and
both the water and earth of that place are usurped, he should pray with
tayammum.

***Issue*** 706: \* The thing on which a person is performing tayammum
should, if possible, on the basis of obligatory precaution, have
particles which would stick to the hands, and after striking hands on
it, one should not shake off all the particles from ones hands.

***Issue*** 707: It is Makrooh to perform tayammum on the earth of a
pit, and street dust, or the saline earth, on which a layer of salt has
not settled. If, however, a layer of salt has settled on the earth,
performance of tayammum on it is void.

### Method of Performing Tayammum Instead of Ghusl or Wudhu

###

***Issue*** 708: \* The following 4 things are obligatory in tayammum
performed instead of Ghusl or Wudhu.

• Intention (Niyyat)

• Striking or keeping both the palms on the object on which tayammum is
valid. As an obligatory precaution, this should be done by both the
palms together.

• Wiping or stroking the entire forehead with the palms of both the
hands, and, as an obligatory precaution, its two ends commencing from
the spot where the hair of one's head grow down to the eyebrows and
above the nose. And it is recommended that the palms pass over the
eyebrows as well.

• To pass the left palm over the whole back of the right hand and
thereafter, to pass the right palm over the whole back of the left hand.

***Issue*** 709: The recommended precaution is that tayammum, whether it
is instead of Ghusl or Wudhu, should be performed in the following
order: First, he/she should strike the hands on the earth to wipe the
forehead and the back of the hands, and then strike the hands on earth
once again to wipe the back of the hands.

### Orders Regarding Tayammum

###

***Issue*** 710: If a person leaves out even a small part of his
forehead or the back of his hands in tayammum, forgetfully or
intentionally, or even due to ignorance, his tayammum will be void.
However, it is not necessary to be very particular; if it can be
ordinarily assumed that the forehead and the backs of the hands have
been wiped, it would be sufficient.

***Issue*** 711: \* In order to be sure that the backs of the hands have
been wiped, wiping should be done from slightly above the wrist, but
wiping in between the fingers is not necessary.

***Issue*** 712: As a precaution, the forehead and the backs of the
hands should be wiped downwards from above, and their acts should be
performed one after the other without undue interruption. If someone
interrupts the

sequence so much that it could not be said that he is doing tayammum,
then tayammum will be void.

***Issue*** 713: \* It is not necessary to determine while making Niyyat
that a particular tayammum is instead of Wudhu or Ghusl. However, if he
has to perform two tayammums, then he must clearly specify which is
instead of Wudhu and which for Ghusl. And even if he fails to determine
correctly the purpose of one tayammum which is obligatory upon him, due
to some error, it will be deemed correct as long as he is aware that he
is discharging his religious obligation.

***Issue*** 714: As a recommended precaution the forehead, the palm of
the hands and the backs of the hands of a person wishing to do tayammum
should be Clean (*tahir/pak* ).

***Issue*** 715: \* While performing tayammum one should remove the ring
one is wearing and also remove any obstruction which may be on his
forehead or on the palms or back of his hands (e.g. if anything is stuck
on them).

***Issue*** 716: If a person has a wound on his forehead or on the back
of his hands and if it is tied with a bandage or something else, which
cannot be removed, he should wipe his hands over it. And if the palm of
his hand is wounded and, bandaged in a way that it cannot be removed, he
should strike his bandaged hands on a thing with which it is permissible
to perform tayammum and then wipe his forehead and the back of his
hands.

***Issue*** 717: There is no harm if there is hair on the forehead or on
the back of hands. However, if the hair of his head fall on his forehead
then it should be pushed back.

***Issue*** 718: If one feels that one has some obstruction on his
forehead or on the palm or back of his hands, an obstruction commonly
known to be so, then one should verify and ensure that the obstruction
is removed.

***Issue*** 719: \* If the obligation of a person is tayammum but he
cannot perform it himself he should solicit assistance. And the one who
assists should make him perform tayammum with his own hands. However, if
this is not possible the assistant should strike his hands on a thing on
which it is lawful to perform tayammum and then wipe it on the person's
forehead and hands. In the first instance, the Niyyat for tayammum by
the person himself will be sufficient, but, as an obligatory precaution,
both he and his assistant should make the Niyyat in both the cases.

***Issue*** 720: If a man doubts while performing tayammum whether or
not he has forgotten a certain part of it, after he has passed that
stage, he should ignore his doubt, and if that stage has not yet passed,
he should perform that part.

***Issue*** 721: \* If, after wiping the left hand, a man doubts whether
or not he has performed his tayammum correctly his tayammum is valid.
But if his doubt is about the wiping of the left hand and if it cannot
be said that he has passed that stage, he should wipe the left hand.

***Issue*** 722: \* A person whose obligation is tayammum and if he does
not hope to be relieved of his excuse during the entire time of Salat,
he can do tayammum. However, if he performs tayammum for some other
obligatory or*Mustahab* act and his excuse (on account of which his
religious

obligation is tayammum) continues till the time for prayers sets in, he
can offer his prayers with that tayammum.

***Issue*** 723: \* If a person whose obligation is tayammum knows that
his excuse will continue till the end of the time of Salat, and has no
hope for its removal, he can offer prayers with tayammum even during the
early part of the time. But, if he knows that his excuse will cease to
exist by the end of the time he should wait and offer prayers with Wudhu
or Ghusl as the case may be. In fact, if he has a glimmer of hope that
his excuse might be removed near the end of Salat time, it will not be
permissible for him to do tayammum and pray, until he loses hope
altogether.

***Issue*** 724: \* If a person, who cannot perform Wudhu or Ghusl, is
sure, or considers it probable, that his excuse will not be removed, he
can offer the Qadha of his past prayers with tayammum. However, if his
excuse is removed afterwards, as a recommended precaution, he should
offer those prayers again with Wudhu or Ghusl. And if he does not lose
all hope about the removal of the excuse, he cannot do tayammum to give
Qadha prayers.

***Issue*** 725: \* It is permissible for a person, who cannot do Ghusl
or Wudhu, to offer with tayammum the daily*Mustahab* prayers for which
the time is fixed. However, if he has hope that his excuse may cease to
exist before the time for prayers is over then, as an obligatory
precaution, he should not offer the*Mustahab* prayers during the earlier
part of their time.

***Issue*** 726: \* If a person does Ghusl in state of Jabira, and
performs tayammum as a measure of precaution, and after having prayed he
experiences a minor hadath (an act which breaks Wudhu, like passing wind
or urinating), he should do Wudhu for subsequent prayers. And if that
hadath had occurred before he had prayed, he should do Wudhu for that
also.

***Issue*** 727: If a person performs tayammum on account of
non-availability of water or because of some other excuse his tayammum
becomes void as soon as that excuse ceases to exist.

***Issue*** 728: The things which invalidate Wudhu invalidate the
tayammum performed instead of Wudhu also. Similarly, the things which
invalidate Ghusl invalidate the tayammum performed instead of Ghusl
also.

***Issue*** 729: If one has upon him several wajib Ghusls, but he cannot
do them, it is permissible for him to perform one tayammum instead of
all those Ghusls, but the recommended precaution is that for each of
those Ghusls he should perform a separate tayammum.

***Issue*** 730: If a person who cannot do Ghusl wishes to perform an
act for which Ghusl is obligatory, he should perform tayammum for Ghusl.
And a person who cannot perform Wudhu wishes to perform an act for which
Wudhu is obligatory, he should perform tayammum instead of Wudhu.

***Issue*** 731: \* If a person performs tayammum instead of Ghusl of
Janabat it is not necessary for him to perform Wudhu for offering
prayers. However, if he performs tayammum instead of other Ghusls, then
as recommended precaution, he should do Wudhu also. And if he cannot do
Wudhu, he should do another tayammum instead of Wudhu.

***Issue*** 732: \* If a person performs tayammum instead of Ghusl of
Janabat and later he commits acts which makes Wudhu void, and if he
still cannot

do Ghusl for later prayers, he should do Wudhu, and as per recommended
precaution, perform tayammum also. And if he cannot do Wudhu, then as a
recommended precaution, he should do tayammum with a hope that his
responsibility is discharged.

***Issue*** 733: If a person whose obligation is to perform tayammum
instead of Wudhu or Ghusl so as to fulfil, for example, an act like
offering prayers,and if in the first tayammum he makes a Niyyat to
perform it instead of Wudhu, or instead of Ghusl and performs the second
tayammum with the Niyyat of carrying out his religious obligation, it is
sufficient.

***Issue*** 734: If a person whose obligation is tayammum performs
tayammum for an act, he can perform all those acts which should be done
with Wudhu or Ghusl, as long as his tayammum and the excuse remain.
However, if his excuse was shortage of Salat time, or if he performed
tayammum for Salat al-Mayyit or to go to sleep in spite of water being
available, then his tayammum is valid for its intention and purpose
only.

***Issue*** 735: In some cases it is better that a person should give
Qadha for the prayers which he offered with tayammum::

• When he was afraid of harm caused by using water and yet intentionally
entered the state of Janabat and offered prayers with tayammum.

• When he knew or suspected that he would not be able to procure water
and yet entered the state of Janabat intentionally and offered prayers
with tayammum.

• When he did not go in search of water intentionally till the time for
prayers became short and he offered the prayers with tayammum and learnt
later that if he had made a search for water he would have been able to
procure it.

• When he delayed offering prayers intentionally and offered it with
tayammum at the end of its time.

• When he threw away the water, although he knew or suspected that he
would not be able to get water, and then offered the prayers with
tayammum.
