O creatures of Allah! The most beloved of Allah is he whom Allah has
given power (to act) against his passions, so that his inner side is
(submerged in) grief and the outer side is covered with fear. The lamp
of guidance is burning in his heart. He has provided entertainment for
the day that is to befall him. He regards what is distant to be near
himself and takes the hard to be light. He looks at and perceives; he
remembers (Allah) and enhances (the tempo of his) actions.

He drinks sweet water to whose source his way has been made easy. So he
drinks to satisfaction and takes the level path. He has put off the
clothes of desires and got rid of worries except one worry peculiar to
him. He is safe from misguidance and the company of people who follow
their passions. He has become the key to the doors of guidance, and the
lock for the doors of destruction.

He has seen his way and is walking on it. He knows his pillar (of
guidance) and has crossed over his deep water. He has caught hold of the
most reliable supports and the strongest ropes. He is on that level of
conviction which is like the brightness of the sun. He has set himself
for Allah, the Glorified, for performance of the most sublime acts of
facing all that befalls him and taking every step needed for it. He is
the lamp in darkness. He is the dispeller of all blindness, key to the
obscure, remover of complexities, and a guide in vast deserts. When he
speaks he makes you understand whereas when he remains silent then it is
safe to do so. He did everything only for Allah and so Allah also made
him His own. Consequently, he is among the mines of His faith and stakes
in His earth.

He has enjoined upon himself (to follow) justice. The first step of his
justice is the rejection of desires from his heart. He describes right
and acts according to it. There is no good which he has not aimed at or
any likely place (of virtue) to which he has not proceeded. He has
placed his reins in the hands of the Qur'an. Therefore the Qur'an is his
guide and leader. He gets down when the Qur'an puts down its weight and
he settles where the Qur'an settles down.

The Characteristics of an unfaithful believer

While the other (kind of) man is he who calls himself learned but he is
not so. He has gleaned ignorance from the ignorant and misguidance from
the misguided. He has set for the people a trap (made) of the ropes of
deceit and untrue speech. He takes the Qur'an according to his own views
and right after his passions.

He makes people feel safe from big sins and takes light the serious
crimes. He says that he is waiting for (clarification of) doubts but he
remains plunged therein, and that he keeps aloof from innovations but
actually he is immersed in them. His shape is that of a man, but his
heart is that of a beast. He does not know the door of guidance to
follow nor the door of misguidance to keep aloof therefrom. These are
living dead bodies.

About the Descendants (\`Itrah) of the Holy Prophet
---------------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">

***"So whither are you going to"*** **(Qur'an, 81:26)**

and

***"how are you then turned away?"*** **(Qur'an, 6:95; 10:34; 35:3;
40:62).**

Ensigns (of guidance) are standing, indications (of virtue) are clear,
and the minarets (of light) have been fixed. Where are you being taken
astray and how are you groping while you have among you the descendants
of the Prophet? They are the reins of Right, ensigns of Faith and
tongues of truth. Accord to them the same good position as you accord to
the Qur'an, and come to them (for quenching the thirst of guidance) as
the thirsty camels approach the water spring.

O people learn this saying[^1] of the last of the Prophets: “He who dies
from among us is not dead, and he who decays (after dying) from among us
does not really decay”. Do not say what you do not understand, because
most of the Right is in what you deny. Accept the argument of one
against whom you have no argument. It is I. Did I not act before you on
the greater *thaqal* (*ath-thaqal al-akbar*, i.e. the Qur'an) and did I
not retain among you the smaller *thaqal* (*ath-thaqal-al-asghar*, i.e.
the descendants of the Prophet)[^2]? I fixed among you the standard of
faith, and I taught you the limits of lawful and unlawful. I clothed you
with the garments of safety with my justice and spread for you (the
carpet of) virtue by my word and deed.

I showed you high manners through myself. Do not exercise your
imagination about what the eye cannot see or the mind cannot conceive.

A part of the same sermon: erroneous ideas about Banu Umayyah
-------------------------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">

Till people begin thinking that the world is attached to the Umayyads,
showering its benefits on them, and leading them to its clear spring for
watering, and that their whip and sword will not be removed from the
people. Whoever thinks so is wrong. There are rather a few drops from
the joys of life which they would suck for a while and then vomit out
the whole of it.

Alternative Sources for Sermon 87
---------------------------------

(1) Al-Zamakhshari, *Rabi\`,* *bab al-\`izz wa al-sharaf;* see also Ibn
Abi al-Hadid, II, 132.

[^1]: This saying of the Prophet is a definite proof of the view that
the life of any one from among the Ahlul Bayt (Household of the Holy
Prophet) does not come to an end and that apparent death makes no
difference in their sense of living, although human intelligence is
unable to comprehend the conditions and happenings of that life. There
are many truths beyond this world of senses which human mind cannot yet
understand. Who can say how in the narrow corner of the grave where it
is not possible even to breathe, replies will be given to the questions
of the angels Munkar and Nakir? Similarly, what is the meaning of life
of the martyrs in the cause of Allah, who have neither sense nor motion,
can neither see nor hear? Although to us they appear to be dead, yet the
Qur'an testifies to their life. And say not of those who are slain in
the path of Allah that they are dead; Nay, (they are) living, but ye
perceive not. (2:154) At another place it says about their life: Reckon
not those who are slain in the way of Allah, to be dead; Nay! alive they
are with their Lord being sustained. (3:169) When restriction has been
placed on mind and tongue even in respect of the common martyrs that
they should not be called dead nor considered dead, how would not those
individuals whose necks were reserved for sword and palate for poison be
living for all times to come. About their bodies Amir al-mu'minin has
said that by passage of time no signs of ageing or decay occur in them,
but they remain in the same state in which they fell as martyrs. There
should be nothing strange in it because dead bodies preserved through
material means still exist. When it is possible to do so through
material means will it be out of the Power of the Omnipotent Creator to
preserve against change and decay the bodies of those upon whom He has
bestowed the sense of everlasting life? Thus about the martyrs of Badr,
the Holy Prophet said: “Shroud them even with their wounds and flowing
blood because when they would rise on the Day of Judgement blood would
be pushing out of their throats”.

[^2]: "ath-thaqal al-akbar" implies the Qur'an and "ath-thaqal
al-asghar" means Ahlul Bayt (the Household of the Holy Prophet) as in
the Prophet's saying: "Verily, I am leaving among you (the) two precious
things (of high estimation and of care)," the reference is to Qur'an and
Ahlul Bayt. There are several reasons for using this word Firstly,
"thaqal" means the kit of a traveller, and since the kit is much in
need, it is protected carefully. Secondly, it means a precious thing;
and since this is of great importance, one is bound to follow the
injunctions of the Qur'an and the actions of Ahlul Bayt. So they have
been called 'precious things'. Since Allah has made arrangements for the
protection of the Qur'an and Ahlul Bayt till doomsday so they have been
called "thaqalayn" . So the Prophet before leaving this world for the
next, declared them to be his valuable possessions and ordered people to
preserve them. Thirdly, then have been called "Thaqalayn" (precious
things) in view of their purity and high value. Thus Ibn Hajar
al-Haytami writes: The Prophet has called the Qur'an and his Descendants
as "thaqalayn" (two precious things) because "thaqal" means a pure,
chaste and preserved thing, and either of these two were really so, each
of them is the treasure of Divine knowledge and a source of scholarly
secrets and religious commandments. For that reason the Prophet desired
the people to follow them and to stick to them and to secure knowledge
from them. Among them the most deserving of attachment is the Imam and
Scholar of the family of the Prophet namely \`Ali ibn Abi Talib (Allah
may honour his face) because of his great insight and copiousness of
knowledge which we have already described. (as-Sawa\`iq al-muhriqah, p.
90) Since the Prophet has with regard to apparent implication attributed
the Qur'an to Allah and the descendants to himself, therefore in keeping
with the natural status the Qur'an has been called the bigger weight
while the descendants, the smaller weight. Otherwise from the point of
view of being followed both are equal and from the point of view of
utility in the development of character there can be no question in the
status of the speaking party (the Ahlul Bayt) being higher than the
silent one (the Qur'an).
