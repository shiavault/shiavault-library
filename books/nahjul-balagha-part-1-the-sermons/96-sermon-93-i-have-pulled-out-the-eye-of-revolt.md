Praise and eulogy be to Allah, O people, I have put out the eye of
revolt. No one except me advanced towards it when its gloom was swelling
and its madness was intense. Ask me before you miss me, [^2] because, by
Allah, who has my life in His hands, if you ask me anything between now
and the Day of Judgement or about the group who would guide a hundred
people and also misguide a hundred people I would tell you who is
announcing its march, who is driving it in the front and who is driving
it at the rear, the stages where its riding animals would stop for rest
and the final place of stay, and who among them would be killed and who
would die a natural death.

أَمَّا بَعْد، أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ فَإِنِّي فَقَأْتُ عَيْنَ الْفِتْنَةِ،
وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لِيَجْتَرِىءَ عَلَيْهَا أَحَدٌ غَيْرِي بَعْدَ أَنْ مَاجَ
غَيْهَبُهَا، وَاشْتَدَّ كَلَبُهَا فَاسْأَلُوني قَبْلَ أَنْ
تَفْقِدُونِي، فَوَ الَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لاَ تَسْأَلُوني عَنْ شَيْء
فِيَما بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ السَّاعَةِ، وَلاَ عَنْ فِئَة تَهْدِي مائةً
وَتُضِلُّ مائةً إِلاَّ نَبَّأْتُكُمْ بِنَاعِقِهَا وَقَائِدِهَا
وَسَائِقِهَا، وَمنَاخِ رِكَابِهَا، وَمَحَطِّ رِحَالِهَا، وَمَنْ
يُقْتَلُ مِنْ أَهْلِهَا قَتْلاً، وَمَنْ يَمُوتُ مِنْهُمْ مَوْتاً.

When I am dead, hard circumstances and distressing events will befall
you, many persons in the position of asking questions will remain silent
with cast down eye, while those in the position of replying will lose
courage. This would be at a time when wars will descend upon you with
all hardship and days will be so hard on you that you would feel them
prolonged because of hardship till Allah will give victory to those
remaining virtuous among you.

مِنَ المَسْؤُولِينَ، وَذلِكَ إِذَا قَلَّصَتْ حَرْبُكُمْ، وَشَمَّرَتْ
عَنْ سَاق، وَضَاقَتِ الدُّنْيَا عَلَيْكُمْ ضِيقاً، تَسْتَطِيلُونَ
أَيَّامَ الْبَلاَءِ عَلَيْكُمْ، حَتَّى يَفْتَحَ اللهُ لِبَقِيَّةِ
الاْبْرَارِ مِنْكُمْ.

When mischiefs come they confuse (right with wrong) and when they clear
away they leave a warning. They cannot be known at the time of approach
but are recognised at the time of return. They blow like the blowing of
winds, striking some cities and missing others.

Beware that the worst mischief for you in my view is the mischief of
Banu Umayyah, because it is blind and also creates darkness. Its sway is
general but its ill effects are for particular people. He who remains
clear-sighted in it would be affected by distress, and he who remains
blind in it would avoid the distress.

By Allah, you will find Banu Umayyah after me worst people for
yourselves, like the old unruly she-camel who bites with its mouth,
beats with its fore-legs, kicks with its hind legs and refuses to be
milked. They would remain over you till they would leave among you only
those who benefit them or those who do not harm them.

Their calamity would continue till your seeking help from them would
become like the seeking of help by the slave from his master or of the
follower from the leader. Their mischief would come to you like evil
eyed fear and pre-Islamic fragments, wherein there would be neither
minaret of guidance nor any sign (of salvation) to be seen.

We *Ahlul Bayt* (the Household of the Prophet) are free from this
mischief and we are not among those who would engender it. Thereafter,
Allah would dispel it from you like the removal of the skin (from flesh)
through him who would humble them, drag them by necks, make them drink
full cups (of hardships), not extend them anything but sword and not
clothe them save with fear. At that time Quraysh would wish at the cost
of the world and all its contents to find me even only once and just for
the duration of the slaughter of a camel in order that I may accept from
them (the whole of) that of which at present I am asking them only a
part but they are not giving me.

[^1]: Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon after the battle of
Nahrawan. In it, mischiefs imply the battles fought in Basrah, Siffin
and Nahrawan because their nature was different from the battles of the
Prophet. There the opposite party was the unbelievers while here the
confrontation was with those who had veils of Islam on their faces. So
people were hesitant to fight against Muslims, and asked why they should
fight with those who recited the call to the prayers and offered the
prayers. Thus, Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-Ansari did not take part in the
Battle of Siffin till the falling of \`Ammar ibn Yasir as martyr did not
prove that the opposite party was rebellious. Similarly the presence of
companions like Talhah and az-Zubayr who were included in the "Foretold
Ten" on the side of \`A'ishah in Basrah, and the prayer signs on
foreheads of the Kharijites in Nahrawan and their prayers and worship
were creating confusion in the minds. In these circumstances only those
could have the courage to rise against them were aware of the secrets of
their hearts and the reality of their faith. It was the peculiar
perception of Amir al-mu'minin and his spiritual courage that he rose to
oppose them, and testified the saying of the Holy Prophet: You will
fight after me with the breakers of allegiance (people of Jamal),
oppressors (people of Syria) and deviators (the Kharijites).

[^2]: After the Holy Prophet no one save Amir al-mu'minin could utter
the challenge "Ask whatever you want to." Ibn \`Abd al-Barr in Jami\`
bayan al-\`ilm wa fadlihi, vol.1 p.58 and in al-Isti\`ab, vol.3, p.l103;
Ibn al-Athir in Usd al-ghabah, vol.4, p.22; Ibn Abi'l-Hadid in Sharh
Nahjul Balaghah, vol.7, p.46; as-Suyuti in Tarikh al-Khulafa', p.171 and
Ibn Hajar al-Haytami in as-Sawa\`iq al-muhriqah, p.76 have written that
"None among the companions of the Holy Prophet ever said 'Ask me
whatever you want to' except \`Ali ibn Abi Talib." However, among other
than the companions a few names do appear in history who did utter such
a challenge, such as Ibrahim ibn Hisham al-Makhzumi, Muqatil ibn
Sulayman, Qatadah ibn Di\`amah, \`Abd ar-Rahman (Ibn al-Jawzi) and
Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi\`i etc. but everyone of them had to face
disgrace and was forced to take back his challenge. This challenge can
be urged only by him who knows the realities of the Universe and is
aware of the happenings of the future. Amir al-mu'minin, the opener of
the door of the Prophet's knowledge, as he was, was the only person who
was never seen being unable to answer any question on any occasion, so
much so that even Caliph \`Umar had to say that "I seek Allah's
protection from the difficulty for the solution of which \`Ali would not
be available." Similarly, the prophecies of Amir al-mu'minin made about
the future proved true word by word and served as an index to his vast
knowledge, whether they be about the devastation of Banu Ummayyah or the
rising of the Kharijites, the wars and destruction by the Tartars or the
attacks of the English, the floods of Basrah of the ruination of Kufah.
In short, when these events are historical realities there is no reason
why this challenge of Amir al-mu'minin should be wondered at.
