O People![^1]

Steer clear through the waves of mischief by boats of deliverance, turn
away from the path of dissension and put off the crowns of pride.
Prosperous is one who rises with wings (i.e. when he has power) or else
he remains peaceful and others enjoy ease. It (i.e. the aspiration for
Caliphate) is like turbid water or like a morsel that would suffocate
the person who swallows it. One who plucks fruits before ripening is
like one who cultivated in another’s field.

If I speak out they would call me greedy towards power but if I keep
quiet they would say I was afraid of death. It is a pity that after all
the ups and downs (I have been through). By Allah, the son of Abu
Talib[^2] is more familiar with death than an infant with the breast of
its mother. I have hidden knowledge, if I disclose it you will start
trembling like ropes in deep wells.

[^1]: When the Holy Prophet died Abu Sufyan was not in Medina. He was
coming back when on his way he got the news of this tragedy. At once he
enquired who had become the leader and Chief. He was told that people
had paid allegiance to Abu Bakr. On hearing this the acknowledged
mischief-monger of Arabia went into deep thought and eventually went to
\`Abbas ibn \`Abd al-Muttalib with a proposal. He said to him, "Look,
these people have by contrivance made over the Caliphate to the Taym and
deprived Banu Hashim of it for good, and after himself this man would
place over our heads a haughty man of Banu \`Adi. Let us go to \`Ali ibn
\`Abi Talib and ask him to get out of his house and take to arms to
secure his right." So taking \`Abbas with him he came to \`Ali and said:
"Let me your hand; I pay allegiance to you and if anyone rises in
opposition I would fill the streets of Medina with men of cavalry and
infantry." This was the most delicate moment for Amir al-mu'minin. He
regarded himself as the true head and successor of the Prophet while a
man with the backing of his tribe and party like Abu Sufyan was ready to
support him. Just a signal was enough to ignite the flames of war. But
Amir al-mu'minin's foresight and right judgement saved the Muslims from
civil war as his piercing eyes perceived that this man wanted to start
civil war by rousing the passions of tribal partisanship and distinction
of birth, so that Islam should be struck with a convulsion that would
shake it to its roots. Amir al-mu'minin therefore rejected his counsel
and admonished him severely and spoke forth the words, whereby he has
stopped people from mischief mongering, and undue conceit, and declared
his stand to be that for him there were only two courses - either to
take up arms or to sit quietly at home. If he rose for war there was no
supporter so that he could suppress these rising insurgencies. The only
course left was quietly to wait for the opportunity till circumstances
were favourable. Amir al-mu'minin's quietness at this stage was
indicative of his high policy and far-sightedness, because if in those
circumstances Medina had become the centre of war its fire would have
engulfed the whole of Arabia in its flames. The discord and scuffle that
had already begun among muhajirun (those who came from Mecca) and ansar
(the locals of Medina) would have increased to maximum, the
wire-pullings of the hypocrites would have had full play, and Islam's
ship would have been caught in such a whirlpool that its balancing would
have been difficult; Amir al-mu'minin suffered trouble and tribulations
but did not raise his hands. History is witness that during his life at
Mecca the Prophet suffered all sorts of troubles but he was not prepared
to clash or struggle by abandoning patience and endurance, because he
realised that if war took place at that stage the way for Islam's growth
and fruition would be closed. Of course, when he had collected
supporters and helpers enough to suppress the flood of unbelief and curb
the disturbances, he rose to face the enemy. Similarly, Amir
al-mu'minin, treating the life of the Prophet as a torch for his
guidance refrained from exhibiting the power of his arm because he was
realising that rising against the enemy without helpers and supporters
would become a source of revolt and defeat instead of success and
victory. Therefore, on this occasion Amir al-mu'minin has likened the
desire for Caliphate to turbid water or a morsel suffocating the throat.
Thus, even where people had forcibly snatched this morsel and wanted to
swallow it by forcible thrusting, it became stuck in their throat. They
could neither swallow it nor vomit it out. That is, they could neither
manage it as is apparent from the blunders they committed in connection
with Islamic injunctions, nor were they ready to cast off the knot from
their neck. He reiterated the same ideas in different words thus: "If
had I attempted to pluck the unripe fruit of Caliphate then by this the
orchard would have been desolated and I too would have achieved nothing,
like these people who cultivate on other's land but can neither guard
it, nor water it at proper time, nor reap any crop from it. The position
of these people is that if I ask them to vacate it so that the owner
should cultivate it himself and protect it, they say how greedy I am,
while if I keep quiet they think I am afraid of death. They should tell
me on what occasion did I ever feel afraid, or flew from battle-field
for life, whereas every small or big encounter is proof of my bravery
and a witness to my daring and courage. He who plays with swords and
strikes against hillocks is not afraid of death. I am so familiar with
death that even an infant is not so familiar with the breast of its
mother. Hark! The reason for my silence is the knowledge that the
Prophet has put in my bosom. If I divulge it you would get perplexed and
bewildered. Let some days pass and you would know the reason of my
inaction, and perceive with your own eyes what sorts of people would
appear on this scene under the name of Islam, and what destruction they
would bring about. My silence is because this would happen, otherwise it
is not silence without reason." A Persian hemistch says: "Silence has
meaning which cannot be couched in words."

[^2]: About death Amir al-mu'minin says that it is so dear to him that
even an infant does not so love to leap towards the source of its
nourishment while in its mother's lap. An infant's attachment with the
breast of its mother is under the effect of a natural impulse but the
dictates of natural impulses change with the advance of age. When the
limited period of infancy ends and the infant's temperament changes, he
does not like even to look at what was so familiar to him but rather
turns his face from it in disgust. But the love of prophets and saints
for union with Allah is mental and spiritual, and mental and spiritual
feelings do not change, nor does weakness or decay occur in them. Since
death is the means and first rung towards this goal their love for death
increases to such an extent that its rigours become the cause of
pleasure for them and its bitterness proves to be the source of delight
for their taste. Their love for it is the same as that of the thirsty
for the well or that of a lost passenger for his goal. Thus when Amir
al-mu'minin was wounded by \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muljam's fatal attack, he
said, "I was but like the walker who has reached (the goal) or like the
seeker who has found (his object) and whatever is with Allah is good for
the pious." The Prophet also said that there is no pleasure for a
believer other than union with Allah.
