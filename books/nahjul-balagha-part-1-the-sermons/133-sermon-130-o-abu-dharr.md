O Abu Dharr! You showed anger in the name of Allah therefore have hope
in Him for Whom you became angry. The people were afraid of you in the
matter of their (pleasure of this) world while you feared them for your
faith. Then leave to them that for which they are afraid of you and get
away from them taking away what you fear them about. How needy are they
for what you dissuade them from and how heedless are you towards what
they are denying you.

You will shortly know who is the gainer tomorrow (on the Day of
Judgement) and who is more enviable. Even if these skies and earth were
closed to some individual and he feared Allah, then Allah would open
them for him. Only rightfulness should attract you while wrongfulness
should detract you. If you had accepted their worldly attractions they
would have loved you and if you had shared in it they would have given
you asylum.

يَاأَبَا ذَرٍّ، إِنَّكَ غَضِبْتَ للهِ، فَارْجُ مَنْ غَضِبْتَ لَهُ،
إِنَّ الْقَوْمَ خَافُوكَ عَلَى دُنْيَاهُمْ، وَخِفْتَهُمْ عَلَى
دِينِكَ، فَاتْرُكْ فِي أَيْدِيهِمْ مَا خَافُوكَ عَلَيْهِ، وَاهْرُبْ
مِنهُمْ بِمَا خِفْتَهُمْ عَلَيْهِ; فَمَا أَحْوَجَهُمْ إِلَى مَا
مَنَعْتَهُمْ، وأَغْنَاكَ عَمَّا مَنَعُوكَ! وَسَتَعْلَمُ مَنِ الرَّابحُ
غَداً، وَالاْكْثَرُ حُسَّداً. وَلَوْ أَنَّ السَّماَوَاتِ وَالاْرَضِينَ
كَانَتَا عَلَى عَبْد رَتْقاً، ثُمَّ اتَّقَى اللهَ، لَجَعَلَ اللهُ لَهُ
مِنْهُمَا مَخْرَجاً! لاَ يُؤْنِسَنَّكَ إِلاَّ الْحَقُّ، وَلاَ
يُوحِشَنَّكَ إِلاَّ الْبَاطِلُ، فَلَوْ قَبِلْتَ دُنْيَاهُمْ
لاَحَبُّوكَ، وَلَوْ قَرَضْتَ مِنْهَا لاَمَّنُوكَ.

[^1]: Abu Dharr al-Ghifari's name was Jundab ibn Junadah. He was an
inhabitant of ar-Rabadhah which was a small village on the east side of
Medina. When he heard about the proclamation of the Prophet, he came to
Mecca and after making enquiries saw the Prophet and accepted Islam
whereupon the unbelievers of Quraysh gave him all sorts of troubles and
inflicted pain after pain, but he remained steadfast. Among the
acceptors of Islam he is the third, fourth or fifth. Along with this
precedence in Islam his renunciation and piety was so high that the
Prophet said: “Among my people Abu Dharr is the like of \`Isa (Jesus)
son of Maryam (Mary) in renunciation and piety”. In the reign of Caliph
\`Umar, Abu Dharr left for Syria and during \`Uthman's reign also
remained there. He spent his days in counselling, preaching, acquainting
people with the greatness of the members of the Prophet's family and
guiding the people to the rightful path. The traces of Shi\`ism now
found in Syria and Jabal \`Amil (north of Lebanon) are the result of his
preaching and activity and the fruit of seeds sown by him. The Governor
of Syria, Mu\`awiyah, did not like the conduct of Abu Dharr and was much
disgusted with his open criticism and mention of the money-making and
other wrongful activities of \`Uthman. But he could do nothing. At last
he wrote to \`Uthman that if he remained there any longer he would rouse
the people against the Caliph. There should therefore be some remedy
against this. On this, \`Uthman wrote to him that Abu Dharr should be
seated on an unsaddled camel and dispatched to Medina. The order was
obeyed and Abu Dharr was sent to Medina. On reaching Medina he resumed
his preaching of righteousness and truth. He would recall to the people
the days of the Holy Prophet and refrain them from displays of kingly
pageantry, whereupon \`Uthman was much perturbed and tried to restrict
his speaking. One day he sent for him and said: "I have come to know
that you go about propagating that the Holy Prophet said that: "When
Banu Umayyah will become thirty in number they will regard the cities of
Allah as their property, His creatures their slaves and His religion the
tool of their treachery." Abu Dharr replied that he had heard the
Prophet say so. \`Uthman said that he was speaking a lie and enquired
from those beside him if any one had heard this tradition and all
replied in the negative. Abu Dharr then said that enquiry should be made
from Amir al-mu'minin \`Ali ibn Abi Talib (p.b.u.h.). He was sent for
and asked about it. He said it was correct and Abu Dharr was telling the
truth. \`Uthman enquired on what basis he gave evidence for the
correctness of this tradition. Amir al-mu'minin replied that he had
heard the Holy Prophet say that: “There is no speaker under the sky or
over the earth more truthful than Abu Dharr”. Now \`Uthman could do
nothing. If he still held him to be liar it would mean falsification of
the Prophet. He therefore kept quiet despite much perturbation, since he
could not refute him. On the other side Abu Dharr began speaking against
the usurping of Muslims' property quite openly and whenever he saw
\`Uthman he would recite this verse: And those who hoard up gold and
silver and spend it not in Allah's way; announce thou unto them a
painful chastisement. On the Day (of Judgement) when it shall be heated
in the fire of hell, then shall be branded with it their foreheads and
their sides and their backs; (saying unto them) "This is what ye hoarded
up for yourselves, taste ye then what ye did hoard up. " (Qur'an,
9:34-35) \`Uthman promised him money but could not entrap this free man
in his golden net, then resorted to repression but could not stop his
truth-speaking tongue. At last he ordered him to leave and go to
ar-Rabadhah and deputised Marwan, son of the man (al-Hakam) exiled by
the Prophet, to turn him out of Medina. At the same time he issued the
inhuman order that no one should speak to him nor see him off. But Amir
al-mu'minin, Imam Hasan, Imam Husayn, \`Aqil ibn Abi Talib, \`Abdullah
ibn Ja\`far and \`Ammar ibn Yasir did not pay any heed to this order and
accompanied him to see him off, and Amir al-mu'minin uttered these
sentences (i.e., the above sermon) on that occasion. In ar-Rabadhah, Abu
Dharr had to put up with a very hard life. It was here that his son
Dharr and his wife died and the sheep and goats that he was keeping for
his livelihood also died. Of his children only one daughter remained,
who equally shared his starvation and troubles. When the means of
subsistence were fully exhausted and day after day passed without food
she said to Abu Dharr: "Father, how long shall we go on like this. We
should go somewhere in search of livelihood." Abu Dharr took her with
him and set off for the wilderness. He could not find even any foliage.
At last he was tired and sat down at a certain place. Then he collected
some sand and, putting his head on it, lay down. Soon he began gasping,
his eyes rolled up and pangs of death gripped him. When the daughter saw
this condition she was perplexed and said, "Father, if you die in this
vast wilderness, how shall I manage for your burial quite alone." He
replied, "Do not get upset. The Prophet told me that I shall die in
helplessness and some Iraqis would arrange for my burial. After my death
you put a sheet over me and then sit by the roadway and when some
caravan passes that way tell them that the Prophet's companion Abu Dharr
has died." Consequently, after his death she went and sat by the
roadside. After some time a caravan passed that way. It included Malik
ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha\`i, Hujr ibn \`Adi at-Ta'i, \`Alqamah
ibn Qays an- Nakha\`i, Sa\`sa\`ah ibn Suhan al-\`Abdi, al-Aswad ibn
Yazid an-Nakha\`i etc. who were all fourteen persons in number. When
they heard about the passing away of Abu Dharr they were shocked at his
helpless death. They stopped their riding beasts and postponed the
onward journey for his burial. Ma1ik al-Ashtar gave a sheet of cloth for
his shroud. It was valued at four thousand Dirhams. After his funeral
rites and burial they departed. This happened in the month of
Dhi'l-hijjah, 32 A.H.
