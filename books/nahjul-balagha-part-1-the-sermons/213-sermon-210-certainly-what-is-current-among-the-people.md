Sermon 210: Certainly what is current among the people…
=======================================================

Someone [^1] asked Amir al-mu'minin about concocted traditions and
contradictory sayings of the Prophet current among the people, whereupon
he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقد سأله سائل عن أحاديث البدع، وعما في أيدي الناس من اختلاف الخبر
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقال (عليه السلام(
  </p>
</blockquote>

Certainly what is current among the people is both right and wrong, true
and false, repealing and repealed, general and particular, definite and
indefinite, exact and surmised. Even during the Prophet's days false
sayings had been attributed to him, so much so that he had to say during
his sermon that, "Whoever attributes falsehoods to me makes his abode in
Hell." Those who relate traditions are of four categories, [^2] no more.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إنَّ فِي أَيْدِي النَّاسِ حَقّاً وَبَاطِلاً، وَصِدْقاً وَكَذِباً،
وَنَاسِخاً وَمَنْسُوخاً، وَعَامّاً وَخَاصّاً، وَمُحْكَماً
وَمُتَشَابِهاً، وَحِفْظاً وَوَهْماً، وَقَدْ كُذِبَ عَلَى رَسُولِ
اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) عَلَى عَهْدِهِ، حَتَّى قَامَ خَطِيباً،
فَقَالَ: «مَنْ كَذَبَ عَلَيَّ مُتَعَمِّداً فَلْيَتَبَوَّأْ مَقْعَدَهُ
مِنَ النَّارِ». وَإِنَّمَا أَتَاكَ بِالْحَدِيثِ أَرْبَعَةُ رِجَال
لَيْسَ لَهُمْ خَامِسٌ:
  </p>
</blockquote>

First: The lying hypocrites
---------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
المنافقون
  </p>
</blockquote>

The hypocrite is a person who makes a show of faith and adopts the
appearance of a Muslim; he does not hesitate in sinning nor does he keep
aloof from vice; he wilfully attributes false things against the
Messenger of Allah - may Allah bless him and his descendants. If people
knew that he was a hypocrite and a liar, they would not accept anything
from him and would not confirm what he says.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
رَجُلٌ مُنَافِقٌ مُظْهِرٌ لِلاْيمَانِ، مُتَصَنِّعٌ بِالاْسْلاَمِ،
لاَيَتَأَثَّمُ وَلاَ يَتَحَرَّجُ، يَكْذِبُ عَلَى رَسُولِ اللهِ (صلى
الله عليه وآله) مُتَعَمِّداً، فَلَوْ عَلِمَ النَّاسُ أَنَّهُ مُنَافِقٌ
كَاذِبٌ لَمْ يَقْبَلُوا مِنْهُ، وَلَمْ يُصَدِّقُوا قَوْلَهُ،
  </p>
</blockquote>

Rather they say that he is the companion of the Prophet, has met him,
heard (his sayings) from him and acquired (knowledge) from him. They
therefore accept what he says. Allah too had warned you well about the
hypocrites and described them fully to you. They have continued after
the Holy Prophet. They gained positions with the leaders of misguidance
and callers towards Hell through falsehoods and slanderings. So, they
put them in high posts and made them officers over the heads of the
people, and amassed wealth through them. People are always with the
rulers and after this world, except those to whom Allah affords
protection. This is the first of the four categories.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَلكِنَّهُمْ قَالُوا: صَاحِبُ رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله) رآهُ،
وَسَمِعَ مِنْهُ، وَلَقِفَ عَنْهُ، فَيَأْخُذُونَ بِقَوْلِهِ، وَقَدْ
أَخْبَرَكَ اللهُ عَنِ الْمُنَاقفِقِينَ بِمَا أَخْبَرَكَ، وَوَصَفَهُمْ
بِمَا وَصَفَهُمْ بِهِ لَكَ، ثُمَّ بَقُوا بَعْدَهُ(عليه السلام)،
فَتَقرَّبُوا إِلَى أَئِمَّةِ الضَّلاَلَةِ، وَالدُّعَاةِ إِلَى النَّارِ
بِالزُّورِ وَالْبُهْتَانِ، فَوَلَّوهُمُ الاْعْمَالَ، وَجَعَلُوهُمْ
عَلَى رِقَابِ النَّاسِ، وَأَكَلُوا بِهِمُ الدُّنْيَا، وَإِنَّمَا
النَّاسُ مَعَ الْمُلُوكِ وَالدُّنْيَا، إِلاَّ مَنْ عَصَمَ اللهُ،
فَهذَا أَحَدُ الاْرْبَعَةِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Second: Those who are mistaken
------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الخاطئون
  </p>
</blockquote>

Then there is the individual who heard (a saying) from the Holy Prophet
but did not memorise it as it was, but surmised it. He does not lie
wilfully. Now, he carries the saying with him and relates it, acts upon
it and claims that: "I heard it from the Messenger of Allah." If the
Muslims come to know that he has committed a mistake in it, they will
not accept it from him, and if he himself knows that he is on the wrong
he will give it up.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَرَجُلٌ سَمِعَ مِنْ رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله) شَيْئاً لَمْ
يَحْفَظْهُ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ، فَوَهِمَ فِيهِ، وَلَمْ يَتَعَمَّدْ كَذِباً،
فَهُوَ فِي يَدَيْهِ، يَرْوِيهِ وَيَعْمَلُ بِهِ، وَيَقُولُ: أَنَا
سَمِعْتُهُ مِنْ رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله)، فَلَوْ عَلِمَ
الْمُسْلِمُونَ أَنَّهُ وَهِمَ فِيهِ لَمْ يَقْبَلُوهُ مِنْهُ، وَلَوْ
عَلِمَ هُوَ أَنَّهُ كَذلِكَ لَرَفَضَهُ .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Third: Those who are ignorant
-----------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أهل الشبهة
  </p>
</blockquote>

The third man is he who heard the Prophet ordering to do a thing and
later the Prophet refrained the people from doing it, but this man did
not know it, or he heard the Prophet refraining people from a thing and
later he allowed it, but this man did not know it. In this way he
retained in his mind what had been repealed, and did not retain the
repealing tradition. If he knew that it had been repealed he would
reject it, or if the Muslims knew, when they heard it from him, that it
had been repealed they would reject it.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَرَجُلٌ ثَالِثٌ، سَمِعَ مِنْ رَسُولِ اللهِ(صلى الله عليه وآله)
شَيْئاً يَأْمُرُ بِهِ، ثُمَّ نَهَى عَنْهُ وَهُوَ لاَ يَعْلَمُ، أَوْ
سَمِعَهُ يَنْهَىُ عَنْ شَيْء، ثُمَّ أَمَرَ بِهِ وَهُوَ لايَعْلَمُ،
فَحَفِظَ المَنسُوخَ، وَلَمْ يَحْفَظِ النَّاسِخَ، فَلَوْ عَلِمَ أَنَّهُ
مَنْسُوخٌ لَرَفَضَهُ، وَلَوْ عَلِمَ الْمُسْلِمُونَ إذْ سَمِعُوهُ
مِنْهُ أَنَّهُ مَنْسُوخٌ لَرَفَضُوهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Fourth: Those who memorise truthfully
-------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الصادقون الحافظون
  </p>
</blockquote>

The last, namely the fourth man, is he who does not speak a lie against
Allah or against His Prophet. He hates falsehood out of fear for Allah
and respect for the Messenger of Allah, and does not commit mistakes,
but retains (in his mind) exactly what he heard (from the Prophet), and
he relates it as he heard it without adding anything or omitting
anything. He heard the repealing tradition, he retained it and acted
upon it, and he heard the repealed tradition and rejected it. He also
understands the particular and the general, and he knows the definite
and indefinite, and gives everything its due position.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَآخَرُ رَابِعٌ، لَمْ يَكْذِبْ عَلَى اللهِ، وَلاَ عَلَى رَسُولِهِ،
مُبْغِضٌ لِلْكَذِبِ، خَوْفاً لله، وَتَعْظيِماً لِرَسُولِ اللهِ، وَلَمْ
يَهِمْ، بَلْ حَفظَ مَا سَمِعَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ، فَجَاءَ بِهِ عَلَى مَا
سَمِعَهُ، لَمْ يَزِدْ فِيهِ وَلَمْ يَنْقُصْ مِنْهُ، وَحَفِظَ
النَّاسِخَ فَعَمِلَ بِهِ، وَحَفِظَ الْمَنْسُوخَ فَجَنَّبَ عَنْهُ،
وَعَرَفَ الْخَاصَّ وَالْعَامَّ، فَوَضَعَ كُلَّ شَيْء مَوْضِعَهُ،
وَعَرفَ المُتَشَابِهَ وَمُحْكَمَهُ .
  </p>
</blockquote>

The sayings of the Prophet used to be of two types. One was particular
and the other common. Sometimes a man would hear him but he would not
know what Allah, the Glorified, meant by it or what the Messenger of
Allah meant by it. In this way the listener carries it and memorises it
without knowing its meaning and its real intention, or what was its
reason.

Among the companions of the Messenger of Allah all were not in the habit
of putting him questions and ask him the meanings, indeed they always
wished that some Bedouin or stranger might come and ask him (peace be
upon him) so that they would also listen. Whenever any such thing came
before me, I asked him about its meaning and preserved it. These are the
reasons and grounds of differences among the people in their traditions.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

وَقَدْ كَانَ يَكُونُ مِنْ رَسُولِ اللهِ (صلى الله عليه وآله)
الْكَلاَمُ لَهُ وَجْهَانِ: فَكَلاَمٌ خَاصٌّ، وَكَلاَمٌ عَامٌّ،
فَيَسْمَعُهُ مَنْ لاَ يَعْرِفُ مَا عَنَى اللهُ بِهِ، وَلاَ مَا عَنَى
بِهِ رَسُولُ اللهِ (صلى الله عليه وآله) فَيَحْمِلُهُ السَّامِعُ،
وَيُوَجِّهُهُ عَلَى غَيْرِ مَعْرِفَة بِمَعْنَاهُ، وَمَا قُصِدَ بِهِ،

(صلى الله عليه وآله) مَنْ كَانَ يَسْأَلُهُ وَيَسْتَفْهِمُهُ، حَتَّى
إِنْ كَانُوا لَيُحِبُّونَ أَنْ يَجِيءَ الاْعْرَابِيُّ أَوْ
الطَّارِىءُ، فَيَسَأَلَهُ (عليه السلام) حَتَّى يَسْمَعُوا، وَكَانَ لاَ
يَمُرُّ بِي مِنْ ذلِكَ شَيْءٌ إِلاَّ سَأَلْتُ عَنْهُ وَحَفِظْتُهُ.
فَهذِهِ وَجُوهُ مَا عَلَيْهِ النَّاسُ فِي اخْتِلاَفِهِمْ، وَعِلَلِهِمْ
فِي رِوَايَاتِهِمْ.

[^1]: This was Sulaym ibn Qays al-Hilali who was one of the relaters of
traditions through Amir al-mu'minin.

[^2]: In this sermon Amir al-mu'minin has divided the traditionists into
four categories. The first category is that of a man concocts a
tradition and attributes it to the Prophet. Traditions were in fact
falsified and attributed to him, and this process continued, with the
result that numerous novel traditions came into being. This is a fact
which cannot be denied but if anyone does deny it his basis would be not
knowledge or sagacity by oratory or argumentative necessity. Thus, once,
\`Alamu'l-huda (Ensign of Guidance) as-Sayyid al-Murtada had a chance of
meeting the Sunni \`ulama' (scholars) in confrontation and on this
occasion as-Sayyid al-Murtada proved by historical facts that the
traditions related about the merits of the great companions are
concocted and counterfeit. On this, the (Sunni) \`ulama' argued that it
was impossible that someone should dare speak a lie against the Prophet
and prepare a tradition himself and attribute it to him. as-Sayyid
al-Murtada said there is a tradition of the Prophet that: A lot of false
things will be attributed to me after my death and whoever speaks a lie
against me would be preparing his abode in Hell. (al-Bukhari, vol.1,
p.38; vol.2, p.102; vol.4, p.207; vol.8, p.54; Muslim, vol.8, p.229; Abu
Dawud, vol.3, pp.319-320; at-Tirmidhi, vol.4, p.524; vol.5, pp.35-36,
40, 199, 634; Ibn Majah, vol.1, pp.13-15) If you regard this tradition
as true then you should agree that false things have been attributed to
the Prophet, but if you regard it false, this would prove our point.
However, these were people whose hearts were full of hypocrisy and who
used to prepare traditions of their own accord in order to create
mischief and dispersion in religion and to misguide Muslims of weak
convictions. They remained mixed with them as they used to do during the
lifetime of the Prophet; and just as they remained busy in activities of
mischief and destruction in those days, in the same way, even after the
Prophet, they were not unmindful of deforming the teachings of Islam and
metamorphosing its features. Rather, in the days of the Prophet they
were always afraid lest he unveiled them and put them to shame, but
after the Prophet their hypocritical activities increased and they
attributed false things to the Prophet without demur for their own
personal ends, and those who heard them believed in them because of
their status as companions of the Prophet, thinking that whatever they
said was correct and whatever they gave out was true. Afterwards also,
the belief that all the companions are correct put a stopper on their
tongues, as a result of which they were taken to be above criticism,
questioning, discussion and censure. Besides, their conspicuous
performance had made them prominent in the eyes of the government, and
also because of this it needed courage and daring to speak against them.
This is proved by Amir al-mu'minin's words: These people gained
positions with the leaders of misguidance and callers towards Hell,
through falsehood and slanderings. So, they put them in high posts and
made them officers over the heads of the people. Along with the
destruction of Islam, the hypocrites also aimed at amassing wealth, and
they were doing so freely by claiming to be Muslims, because of which
they did not want to remove the veil of Islam (from their faces) and to
come out openly, but they wanted to continue their Satanic activities
under the garb of Islam and engaged themselves in its basic destruction
and spreading of division and dispersal by concocting traditions. In
this connection, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written: When they were left free
they too left many things. When people observed silence about them they
also observed silence about Islam, but they continued their underground
activities such as the fabrication of falsehoods to which Amir
al-mu'minin has alluded, because a lot of untrue matters had been mixed
with the traditions by the group of people of wrong beliefs, while some
of them also aimed at extolling some particular party with whom they had
other worldly aims as well. On the expiry of this period, when
Mu\`awiyah took over the leadership of religion and occupied the throne
of temporal authority, he opened an official department for the
fabrication of false traditions, and ordered his officers to fabricate
and popularise traditions in disparagement of the Ahlul Bayt (the
Household of the Holy Prophet) and in extolment of \`Uthman and the
Umayyads, and announced rewards and grants of land for this work.
Consequently, a lot of traditions about self-made distinctions gained
entry in the books of traditions. Thus, Abu'l-Hasan al-Mada'ini has
written in his book Kitab al-ahdath and Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has quoted it,
namely: Mu\`awiyah wrote to his officers that they should take special
care of those who were adherents of \`Uthman, his well-wishers and
lovers and to award high positions, precedence and honour to those who
related traditions about his merits and distinctions, and to convey to
him whatever is so related by any person, along with his name, the name
of his father and the name of his tribe. They did accordingly and heaped
up traditions about the merits and distinctions of \`Uthman because
Mu\`awiyah used to award them rewards, clothes, grants and lands. When
the fabricated traditions about the merits of \`Uthman had been spread
throughout the realm, with the idea that the position of the earlier
Caliphs should not remain low, Mu\`awiyah wrote to his officers: As soon
as you receive this order of mine you should call upon the people to
prepare traditions about the distinctions of the companions and other
caliphs also, and take care that if any Muslim relates any tradition
about Abu Turab (\`Ali) you should prepare a similar tradition about the
companions to contradict it because this gives me great pleasure and
cools my eyes, and it weakens the position of Abu Turab and his
partymen. and is more severe to them than the merits and distinctions of
\`Uthman. When his letters were read to the people, a large number of
such traditions were related extolling the companions that are all
fabricated with no truth at all. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 11, pp.
43-47) In this connection Abu \`Abdillah Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn
\`Arafah known as Niftawayh (244/858-323/935) who was one of the
prominent scholars and traditionists has written, and Ibn Abi'l-Hadid
has quoted him, that: Most of the false traditions about the merits of
the companions were fabricated during the days of Mu\`awiyah in order to
gain position in his audience because his view was that in this way he
could disgrace Banu Hashim and render them low. (ibid.) After that,
fabrication of traditions became a habit, the world seekers made it a
means of securing position with kings and nobles and to amass wealth.
For example, Ghiyath ibn Ibrahim an-Nakha\`i (2nd cent. A.H.) fabricated
a tradition about the flight of pigeons, in order to please al-Mahdi ibn
al-Mansur (the \`Abbasid Caliph) and to secure position near him.
(Tarikh Baghdad, vol.12, pp.323-327; Mizan al-i\`tidal, vol.3)
pp.337-338; Lisan al-mizan, vol.4, p.422). Abu Sa\`id al-Mada'ini and
others made it a means of livelihood. The limit was reached when the
al-Karramiyyah and some of the al-Mutasawwifah gave the ruling that the
fabrication of traditions for the prevention of sin or for persuasion
towards obedience was lawful. Consequently, in connection with
persuading and dissuading, traditions were fabricated quite freely, and
this was not regarded against the religious law or morality. Rather,
this work was generally done by those who bore the appearance of
asceticism or fear of Allah and who passed their nights in praying and
days in filling their registers with false traditions. An idea about the
number of these fabricated traditions can be had from the fact that out
of six hundred thousand traditions al-Bukhari selected only two thousand
seven hundred and sixty-one traditions, (Tarikh Baghdad, vol.2, p.8;
al-Irshad as-sari, vol.1, p.28; Sifatu's-safwah, vol.4, p.143). Muslim
thought fit for selection only four thousand out of three hundred
thousand (Tarikh Baghdad, vol.13, p.101; al-Muntazam, vol.5, p.32;
Tabaqat al-huffaz, vol.2, pp.151,157; Wafayat al-a\`yan, vol.5, p.194).
Abu Dawud took four thousand and eight hundred out of five hundred
thousand (Tarikh Baghdad, vol.9, p.57; Tabaqat al-huffaz, vol.2, p.154;
al-Muntazam, vol.5, p.97; Wafayat al-a\`yan, vol.2, p.404), and Ahmad
ibn Hanbal took thirty thousand out of nearly on million traditions
(Tarikh Baghdad, vol.4, p.419-420; Tabaqat al-huffaz, vol.2, p.17;
Wafayat al-a\`yan, vol.1, p.64; Tahdhib at-tahdhib, vol.1, p. 74). But
when this selection is studied some traditions which come across can, in
no circumstances, be attributed to the Prophet. The result is that a
group of considerable number has cropped up among Muslims who, in view
of these (so-called) authoritative collections and true traditions,
completely reject the evidentiary value of the traditions, (For further
reference see al-Ghadir, vol.5, pp. 208-378). The second category of
relaters of traditions are those who, without appreciating the occasion
or context, related whatever they could recollect, right or wrong. Thus,
in al-Bukhari (vol.2, pp.100-102; vol.5, p.98); Muslim (vol.3, pp.
41-45); at-Tirmidhi (vol.3, pp. 327-329); an-Nasa'i (vol.4, p.18); Ibn
Majah (vol.1, pp.508-509); Malik ibn Anas (al-Muwatta' vol.1, p.234);
ash-Shafi\`i (Ikhtilaf'l-hadith, on the side lines of "al-Umm", vol.7,
p.266); Abu Dawud (vol.3, p.194); Ahmad ibn Hanbal (vol.1, pp.41,42) and
al-Bayhaqi (vol.4, pp.72-74) in the chapter entitled 'weeping over the
dead' it is stated that when Caliph \`Umar was wounded Suhayb came
weeping to him, then \`Umar said: O' Suhayb, you weep over me, while the
Prophet had said that the dead person is punished if his people weep
over him. When after the death of Caliph \`Umar this was mentioned to
\`A'ishah, she said: "May Allah have mercy on \`Umar. The Messenger of
Allah did not say that weeping of relations causes punishment on the
dead. but he said that the punishment of an unbeliever increases if his
people weep over him." After this \`A'ishah said that according to the
Holy Qur'an no person has to bear the burden of another, so how could
the burden of those who weep be put on the dead. After this the
following verse was quoted by \`A'ishah: . . . And no bearer of burden
shall bear the burden of another; (Qur'an, 6:164; 17:15; 35:18; 39:7;
53:38). The wife of the Holy Prophet \`A'ishah relates that once the
Prophet passed by a Jewish woman over whom her people were weeping. The
Prophet then remarked, "Her people are weeping over her but she is
undergoing punishment in the grave." The third category of the relaters
of traditions is of those who heard some repealed traditions from the
Prophet but could not get any chance to hear the repealing traditions
which he could relate to others. An example of a repealing tradition is
the saying of the Prophet which also contains a reference to the
repealed tradition, namely: "I had disallowed you to visit graves, but
now you can visit them." (Muslim, vol.3, p.65; at-Tirmidhi, vol.3,
p.370; Abu Dawud, vol.3, pp. 218, 332; an-Nasa'i, vol.4, p. 89; Ibn
Majah, vol.1, pp. 500-501; Malik ibn Anas, vol.2, p. 485; Ahmad ibn
Hanbal, vol.1, pp.145, 452; vol.3, pp.38, 63, 66, 237, 350; vol.5, pp.
350, 355, 356, 357, 359, 361; al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, vol.1, pp.
374-376; and al-Bayhaqi, vol.4, pp. 76-77). Herein the permission to
visit graves has repealed the previous restriction on it. Now, those who
heard only the repealed tradition continued acting according to it. The
fourth category of relaters of traditions is of those who were fully
aware of the principles of justice, possessed intelligence and sagacity,
knew the occasion when a tradition was first uttered (by the Prophet)
and were also acquainted with the repealing and the repealed traditions,
the particular and the general, and the timely and the absolute. They
avoided falsehood and fabrication. Whatever they heard remained
preserved in their memory, and they conveyed it with exactness to
others. It is they whose traditions are the precious possession of
Islam, free from fraud and counterfeit and worthy of being trusted and
acted upon. That collection of traditions which has been conveyed
through trustworthy bosoms like that of Amir al-mu'minin and has
remained free from cutting, curtailing, alteration or change
particularly present Islam in its true form. The position of Amir
al-mu'minin in Islamic knowledge has been most certainly proved through
the following traditions narrated from the Holy Prophet such as: Amir
al-mu'minin, Jabir ibn \`Abdullah, Ibn \`Abbas and \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar
have narrated from the Holy Prophet that he said: I am the city of
knowledge and \`Ali is its door. He who wants to acquire (my) knowledge
should come through its door. (al-Mustadrak, vol.3, pp. 126-127;
al-Isti\`ab, vol.3, p.1102; Usd al-ghabah, vol.4, p.22; Tarikh Baghdad,
vol.2, p.377; vol.4, p.348; vol.7, p.172; vol.11, pp. 48-50; Tadhkirah
al-huffaz; vol.4, p.28; Majma\` az-zawa'id, vol.9, p.114; Tahdhib
at-tahdhib, vol.6, p.320; vol.7, p.337; Lisan al-mizan, vol.2,
pp.122-123; Tarikh al-khulafa', p.170; Kanz al-\`ummal, vol.6,
pp.152,156,401; \`Umdah al-qari, vol.7, p.631; Sharh al-mawahib
al-ladunniyyah, vol.3, p.143). Amir al-mu'minin and Ibn \`Abbas have
also narrated from the Holy Prophet that: I am the store-house of wisdom
and \`Ali is its door. He who wants to acquire wisdom should come
through its door. (Hilyah al-awliya', vol.1, p.64; Masabih as-sunnah,
vol.2, p.275; Tarikh Baghdad, vol.11, p.204; Kanz al-\`ummal, vol.6,
p.401; ar-Riyad an-nadirah, vol.2, p.193). If only people could take the
Prophet's blessings through these sources of knowledge. But it is a
tragic chapter of history that although traditions are accepted through
the Kharijites and enemies of the Prophet's family, whenever the series
of relaters includes the name of any individual from among the Prophet's
family there is hesitation in accepting the tradition.
