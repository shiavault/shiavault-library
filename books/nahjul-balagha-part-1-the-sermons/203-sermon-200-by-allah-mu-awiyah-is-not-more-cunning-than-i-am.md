treason*

By Allah, [^1] Mu\`awiyah is not more cunning than I am, but he deceives
and commits evil deeds. Had it not been for the reprehensibility of
deceit, I would have been the most cunning of all men. But (the fact is
that) every deceit is a sin and every sin is disobedience (of Allah),
and every deceitful person will have a banner by which he will be
recognised on the Day of Judgement. By Allah, I cannot be made forgetful
by strategy, nor can I be overpowered by hardships.

وَاللهِ مَا مُعَاوِيَةُ بِأَدْهَى مِنِّي، وَلكِنَّهُ يَغْدِرُ
وَيَفْجُرُ، وَلَوْلاَ كَرَاهِيَةُ الْغَدْرِ لَكُنْتُ مِنْ أَدْهَى
النَّاسِ، وَلَكِنْ كُلُّ غَدْرَة فَجْرَةٌ، وَكُلُّ فَجْرَة كَفْرَةٌ،
وَلِكُلِّ غَادِر لِوَاءٌ يُعْرَفُ بِهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ. وَاللهِ
مَا أَسْتَغْفَلُ بالْمَكِيدَةِ، وَلاَ أُسْتَغْمَزُ بالشَّدِيدَةِ.

[^1]: People who are ignorant of religion and ethics free from the
shackles of religious law and unaware of the conception of punishment
and reward find no paucity of excuses and means for the achievement of
their objects. They can find ways of success at every stage; but when
the dictates of humanity, or Islam, or the limitations imposed by ethics
and religious law act as impediments, the chances of devising and
finding means become narrow, and the possibility of action becomes
restricted. Mu\`awiyah's influence and control was the result of these
devices and ways in following which he knew no impediment nor any
obstacle of what is lawful or unlawful, nor did fear of the Day of
Judgement prevent him from acting fearlessly. As al-\`Allamah ar-Raghib
al-Isfahani while taking account of his characters writes: "His aim
always was to achieve his object whether lawful or unlawful. He did not
care for religion nor did he ever think of divine chastisement. Thus, in
order to maintain his power he resorted to mis-statements and
concoctions, practised all sorts of deceits and contrivances. When he
saw that success was not possible without entangling Amir al-mu'minin in
war he roused Talhah and az-Zubayr against him. When success could not
be achieved by this means he instigated the Syrians and brought about
the civil war of Siffin. And when his rebellious position had become
known by the killing of \`Ammar, he at once duped the people by saying
that \`Ali was responsible for killing him as he had brought him into
the battlefield; and on another occasion he interpreted the words
'rebellious party' occurring in the saying of the Prophet to mean
'avenging party' intending to prove that \`Ammar would be killed by the
group that would seek revenge of \`Uthman's blood, although the next
portion of this saying namely 'he will call them towards Paradise while
they will call him to Hell,' does not leave any scope for
interpretation. When there was no hope of victory even by these cunning
means, he contrived to raise the Qur'an on spears, although in his view
neither the Qur'an nor its commandments carried any weight. If he had
really aimed at a decision by the Qur'an, he should have put this demand
before the commencement of the battle, and when it became known to him
that the decision had been secured by \`Amr ibn al-\`As by deceiving Abu
Musa al-Ash\`ari, and that it did not have even a remote connection with
the Qur'an, he should not have accepted it and should have punished
\`Amr ibn al-\`As for this cunning, or at least should have warned and
rebuked him. But on the contrary, his performance was much appreciated
and in reward he was made the Governor of Egypt." In contrast to this
Amir al-mu'minin's conduct was a high specimen of religious law and
ethics. He kept in view the requirements of truth and righteousness even
in adverse circumstances and did not allow his chaste life to be
tarnished by the views of deceit and contrivance. If he wished he could
face cunning by cunning, and Mu\`awiyah's shameful activities could have
been answered by similar activities. For example, when he put a guard on
the Euphrates and stopped the supply of its water (to Amir al-mu'minin's
men), then the supply of water could have been cut from them also on the
grounds that since they had occupied the Euphrates it was lawful to
retaliate, and in this way they could be overpowered by weakening their
fighting power. But Amir al-mu'minin could never tarnish his hands with
such an inhuman act which was not permitted by any law or code of
ethics, although common people regard such acts against the enemy as
lawful and call this duplicity of character for achievement of success,
a stroke of policy and administrative ability. But Amir al-mu'minin
could never think of strengthening his power by fraud or duplicity of
behaviour on any occasion. Thus when people advised him to retain the
officers of the days of \`Uthman in their position and to befriend
Talhah and az-Zubayr by assigning them governorship of Kufah and Basrah,
and make use of Mu\`awiyah's ability in administration by giving him the
government of Syria, Amir al-mu'minin rejected the advice and preferred
the commandments of religious law over worldly expediency, and openly
declared about Mu\`awiyah as follows: If I allow Mu\`awiyah to retain
what he already has I would be one "who taketh those who lead (people)
astray, as helpers" (Qur'an, 18:51). Those who look at apparent
successes do not care to find out by what means the success has been
achieved. They support anyone whom they see succeeding by means of
cunning ways and deceitful means and begin to regard him an
administrator, intelligent, a politician, intellectually brilliant and
so on, while he who does not deploy cunning and fraudulent methods owing
to his adherence to Islamic commandments and divine instructions and
prefers failure to success secured through wrong methods is regarded as
ignorant of politics and weak in foresight. They do not feel it
necessary to think what difficulties and impediments exist in the way of
a person who adheres to principles and laws which prevent him from
proceeding forward even after approaching near success."
