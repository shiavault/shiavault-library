They[^1] have made Satan the master of their affairs, and he has taken
them as partners. He has laid eggs and hatched them in their bosoms. He
creeps and crawls in their laps. He sees through their eyes, and speaks
with their tongues. In this way he has led them to sinfulness and
adorned for them foul things like the action of one whom Satan has made
partner in his domain and speaks untruth through his tongue.

اتَّخَذُوا الشَّيْطَانَ لاِمْرِهِمْ مِلاَكاً، وَاتَّخَذَهُمْ لَهُ
أَشْرَاكاً، فَبَاضَ وَفَرَّخَ في صُدُورِهِمْ، وَدَبَّ وَدَرَجَ في
حُجُورِهِمْ، فَنَظَرَ بِأَعْيُنِهِمْ، وَنَطَقَ بِأَلسِنَتِهِمْ،
فَرَكِبَ بِهِمُ الزَّلَلَ، وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الخَطَلَ، فِعْلَ مَنْ قَدْ
شَرِكَهُ الشَّيْطَانُ في سُلْطَانِهِ، وَنَطَقَ بِالبَاطِلِ عَلى
لِسَانِهِ!

(2) Ibn al-'Athir, *al-Nihayah,* II, 50. *(kh-t-l )*

[^1]: Amir al-mu'minin says about the hypocrites (i.e. those who opposed
him before and during his Caliphate) that they are partners in action of
Satan and his helpers and supporters. He too has befriended them so much
that he has made his abode with them, resides on their bosoms, lays eggs
and hatches young ones from them there, while these young ones jump and
play in their laps without demur. He means that Satanic evil ideas take
birth in their bosoms and grow and thrive there. There is no restraint
on them, nor restriction of any kind. He has so permeated in their blood
and mingled in their spirit that both have become completely unified.
Now eyes are theirs but sight is his, the tongue is theirs but the words
are his, as the Prophet had said, "Verily, Satan permeates the progeny
of Adam like blood." That is, just as the circulation of blood does not
stop, in the same way the quick succession of Satan's evil ideas know no
break and he draws man towards evil in sleep and wakefulness, and in
every posture, rising or sitting. He so paints them with his dye that
their word and action reflect an exact portrait of his word and action.
Those whose bosoms shine with the effulgence of faith prevent such evil
ideas but some are already ready to welcome those evils and these are
the persons who under the garb of Islam are ever after advancement of
heresy.
