Sermon 60: By Allah! No, not yet….
==================================

*When Amir al-mu'minin was told that the Kharijites had been totally
killed, he said:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">

وقال (عليه السلام)

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لمّا قتل الخوارج
  </p>

  <p>
فقيل له: يا أميرالمؤمنين، هلك القوم بأجمعهم، فقال:
  </p>
</blockquote>

By Allah! No, not yet. They still exist in the loins of men and wombs of
women. Whenever a chief would appear from among them, he would be cut
down till the last of them would turn thieves and robbers. [^1]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَلاَّ وَالله، إِنَّهُمْ نُطَفٌ فِي أَصْلاَبِ الرِّجَالِ، وَقَرَارَاتِ
النِّسَاءِ، كُلَّمَا نَجَمَ مِنْهُمْ قَرْنٌ قُطِعَ، حَتَّى يَكُونَ
آخِرُهُمْ لُصُوصاً سَلاَّبِينَ.
  </p>
