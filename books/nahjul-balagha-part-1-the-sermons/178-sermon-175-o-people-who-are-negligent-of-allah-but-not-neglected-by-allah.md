O people who are (negligent of Allah but) not neglected (by Allah), and
those who miss (doing good acts) but are to be caught. How is it that I
see you becoming removed from Allah and becoming interested in others?
You are like the camel whom the grazer drives to a disease-stricken
pasture and a disastrous watering place. They are like beasts who are
fed in order to be slaughtered, but they do not know what is intended
for them. When they are treated well they think that day to be their
whole life, and eating their full to be their aim.

By Allah, if I wish, I can tell every one of you from where he has come,
where he has to go and all his affairs, but I fear lest you abandon the
Messenger of Allah - peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his
progeny - in my favour. I shall certainly convey these things to the
selected ones who will remain safe from that fear. By Allah, Who deputed
the Prophet with Right and distinguished him over creation. I do not
speak save the truth. He (the Prophet) informed me of all this and also
about the death of every one who dies, the salvation of every one who is
granted salvation, and the consequences of this matter (the caliphate).
He left nothing (that could) pass into my head without putting it in my
ear and telling me about it. [^1]

O people! By Allah, I do not impel you to any obedience unless I
practise it before you and do not restrain you from any disobedience
unless I desist from it before you.

[^1]: Those who drink from the springs of revelation and divine
inspiration see things hidden behind the curtains of the unknown and the
events which will occur in the future in the same way as objects can be
seen with the eyes, and this does not conflict with the saying of Allah
that: Say: "None (either) in the heavens or in the earth knoweth the
unseen save Allah..." (Qur'an, 27:65) because this verse contains the
negation of personal knowledge of the unknown, but not the negation of
knowledge which is required by the prophets and holy persons through
divine inspiration, by virtue of which they make prophesies about the
future and unveil many events and happenings. Several verses of the
Qur'an support this view such as: When the Prophet confided unto one of
his wives a matter, but when she divulged it (unto others) and Allah
apprised him thereof, he made known a part of it and avoided a part; so
when he informed her of it, said she: "Who informed thee of this?" He
said: "Informed me, the All-knowing, the All-aware." (Qur'an, 66:3)
These are of the tidings of the unseen which We reveal unto thee (O' Our
Prophet Muhammad )...(Qur'an, 11:49) Therefore, it is incorrect to argue
in support of the view that if it is said that the prophets and holy
persons possess knowledge of the unknown it would imply duality in the
divine attributes. It would have implied duality if it were said that
someone other than Allah has personal knowledge of the unknown. When it
is not so and the knowledge possessed by the Prophets and Imams is that
given by Allah it has no connection with duality. If duality should mean
what is alleged, what would be the position of \`Isa's (Jesus's)
assertion related in the Qur'an namely: . . . Out of clay will I make
for you like the figure of a bird, and I will breathe into it, and it
shall become a flying bird by Allah's permission; and I shall heal the
blind and the leper and will rise the dead to life by Allah 's
permission; and I will declare to you what ye eat and what ye store up
in your houses. . . (Qur'an, 3 :49) If it is believed that \`Isa (Jesus)
could create and bestow life with Allah's permission does it mean that
he was Allah's partner in the attributes of creation and revival? If
this is not so then how can it be held that if Allah gives someone the
knowledge of the unknown it implies that he has been taken to be His
partner in His attributes, and how can one extol one's belief in the
oneness of Allah by holding that the knowledge of the unknown implies
duality. No one can deny the fact that some people either see in dreams
certain things which have yet to occur in the future, or that things can
be read through interpretation of the dream, while during a dream
neither do the senses function nor do the powers of understanding and
comprehension co-operate. Therefore, if some events become known to some
people in wakefulness why should there be amazement over it and what are
the grounds for rejecting it, when it stands to reason that things
possible in dreams are also possible in wakefulness. Thus, Ibn Maytham
al-Bahrani has written that it is possible to achieve all this, because
in a dream the spirit becomes free from looking after the body and is
removed from bodily connections; as a result of this it perceives such
hidden realities which could not be seen because of the obstruction of
the body. In the same way those perfect beings who pay no heed to bodily
matters, and turn with all the attention of spirit and heart towards the
centre of knowledge can see those realities and secrets which the
ordinary eyes are unable to discern. Therefore, keeping in view the
spiritual greatness of Ahlul Bayt (members of the Prophet's family) it
should not appear strange that they were aware of events which were
going to occur in future. Ibn Khaldun has written: "When thaumaturgic
feats are performed by others what do you think about those who were
distinguished in knowledge and honesty and were a mirror of the
Prophet's traits, while the consideration Allah had for their noble root
(namely the Prophet) is a proof of the high performances of his chaste
off-shoots (Ahlul Bayt). Consequently many events about knowledge of the
unknown are related about Ahlul Bayt which are not related about
others.." (al-Muqaddamah, p. 23). In this way there is no cause for
wonder over Amir al-mu'minin's claim since he was brought up by the
Prophet and was a pupil of Allah's school. Of course, those whose
knowledge does not extend beyond the limits of physical objectivity and
whose means of learning are confined to the bodily senses refuse to
believe in the knowledge about the paths of divine cognisance and
reality. If this kind of claim were unique and were heard only from over
Amir al-mu'minin then minds could have wavered and temperaments could
have hesitated in accepting it, but if the Qur'an records even such a
claim of \`Isa (Jesus) that - "I can tell you what you eat or drink or
store in your houses," then why should there be hesitation over Amir
al-mu'minin's claim, when it is agreed that Amir al-mu'minin had
succeeded to all the attainments and distinctions of the Prophet and it
cannot be contended that the Prophet did not know what \`Isa (Jesus)
knew. Thus, if the successor of the Prophet advances such a claim, why
should it be rejected, particularly as this vastness of knowledge of
Amir al-mu'minin is the best evidence and proof for the Prophet's
knowledge and perfection and a living miracle of his truthfulness. In
this connection, it is amazing that even having knowledge of events Amir
al-mu'minin did not, through any of his words or deeds, indicate that he
knew them. Thus, commenting of the extraordinary importance of this
claim, as-Sayyid Ibn Tawus writes: "An amazing aspect of this claim is
that despite the fact that Amir al-mu'minin was aware of conditions and
events, yet he observed such conduct by way of his words and deeds that
one who saw him could not believe that he knew the secrets and unknown
acts of others, because the wise agree that if a person knows what event
is likely to take place or what step his comrade is going to take, or if
the hidden secrets of people are known to him, then the effects of such
knowledge would appear through his movements and the expressions of his
face. But the man who, in spite of knowing everything, behaves in a way
as though he is unaware and knows nothing, then his personality is a
miracle and a combination of contradictions." At this stage, the
question arises as to why Amir al-mu'minin did not act upon the dictates
of his secret knowledge. The reply to this is that the commands of the
shari\`ah are based on apparent conditions. Otherwise secret knowledge
is a kind of miracle and power which Allah grants to His prophets and
Imams. Although the prophets and Imams possess this power always, they
cannot make use of it at any time unless and until by the permission of
Allah and on the proper occasion. For example, the verse quoted above
about \`Isa (Jesus) which tells that he had the power to give life, to
heal the blind and declare what one ate and stored in his house, etc.,
he (Jesus) did not used to practise this power on every thing or every
corpse or everyone who met him. He used to practise this power only by
the permission of Allah and on the proper occasion. If prophets and
other divines acted on the basis of their secret knowledge it would have
meant serious dislocation and disturbance in the affairs of the people.
For example, if a prophet or divine, on the basis of his secret
knowledge, punishes a condemnable man by killing him, there would be
great commotion and agitation among those who see it on the ground that
he killed an innocent man. That is why Allah has not permitted the
basing of conclusions on secret knowledge save in a few special cases,
and has enjoined the following of observable factors. Thus, despite his
being aware of the hypocrisy of some of the hypocrites, the Prophet
extended to them the treatment that should be extended to a Muslim. Now,
there can be no scope for the objection that if Amir al-mu'minin knew
secret matters then why did he not act according to them because it has
been shown that he was not obliged to act according to the requirements
of his secret knowledge. Of course, where conditions so required he did
disclose some matters for the purposes of preaching, admonishing, giving
good tidings (of reward) or warning (against punishment), so that future
events could be fore-closed. For example, Imam Ja\`far as-Sadiq
(p.b.u.h.) informed Yahya ibn Zayd that if he went out he would be
killed. Ibn Khaldun writes in this connection: "It has been
authentically related from Imam Ja\`far as-Sadiq that he used to apprise
some of his relations of the events to befall them. For example, he
warned his cousin Yahya ibn Zayd of being killed but he disobeyed him
and went out and was killed in Juzajan." (al-Muqaddamah, p. 233).
Nevertheless, where there was apprehension that minds would get worried
it was not at all disclosed. That is why in this sermon Amir al-mu'minin
avoided more details, in view of the fear that people would begin to
regard him higher than the Prophet. Despite all this people did go
astray about \`Isa (Jesus), and in the same way about Amir al-mu'minin
also they began to say all sorts of things and were misled into
resorting to exaggeration.
