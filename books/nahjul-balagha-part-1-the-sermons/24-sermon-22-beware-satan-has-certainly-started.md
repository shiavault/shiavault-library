allegiance to him*

Beware! Satan has certainly started instigating his forces and has
collected his army in order that oppression may reach its extreme ends
and wrong may come back to its position. By Allah they have not put a
correct blame on me, nor have they done justice between me and
themselves.

لِيَعُودَ الجَوْرُ إِلَى أَوْطَانِهِ، وَيَرْجِعَ البِاطِلُ إِلَى
نِصَابِهِ وَاللهِ مَا أَنْكَرُوا عَلَيَّ مُنْكَراً، وَلاَ جَعَلُوا
بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَهُمْ نَصِفاً

Criticism of their actions
--------------------------

They are demanding of me a right which they have abandoned, and a blood
that they have themselves shed.[^1] If I were a partner with them in it
then they too have their share of it. But if they did it without me they
alone have to face the consequences. Their biggest argument (against me)
is (really) against themselves.

They are suckling from a mother who is already dry, and bringing into
life innovation that is already dead. How disappointing is this
challenger (to battle)? Who is this challenger and for what is he being
responded to? I am happy that the reasoning of Allah has been exhausted
before them and He knows (all) about them.

سَفَكُوهُ، فَلَئِنْ كُنْتُ شَرِيكَهُمْ فِيهِ فَإِنَّ لَهُمْ
لَنَصِيبَهُمْ مِنْهُ، وَلَئِنْ كَانُوا وَلُوهُ دُوني، فَمَا
التَّبِعَةُ إِلاَّ عِنْدَهُمْ، وَإِنَّ أَعْظَمَ حُجَّتِهِمْ لَعَلَى
أَنْفُسِهِمْ، يَرْتَضِعُونَ أُمّاً قَدْ فَطَمَتْ وَيُحْيُونَ بِدْعَةً
قَدْأُمِيتَتْ. يا خَيْبَةَ الدَّاعِي! مَنْ دَعَا! وَإِلاَمَ أُجِيبَ!
وَإِنِّي لَرَاضٍ بِحُجَّةِ اللهِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَعِلْمِهِ فِيهمْ.

The threat to wage war against them

If they refuse (to obey) I will offer them the edge of the sword which
is enough a curer of wrong and supporter of Right.

It is strange they send me word to proceed to them for spear-fighting
and to keep ready for fighting with swords. May the mourning women mourn
over them. I have ever been so that I was never frightened by fighting
nor threatened by clashing. I enjoy full certainty of belief from My God
and have no doubt in my faith.

فَإِنْ أَبَوْا أَعْطَيْتُهُمْ حَدَّ السَّيْفِ، وَكَفَى بِهِ شَافِياً
مِنَ البَاطِلِ، وَنَاصَراً لِلْحَقِّ! وَمِنَ العَجَبِ بَعْثُهُمْ
إِلَيَّ أَنْ أَبْرُزَ لِلطِّعَانِ! وَأَنْ أصْبِرَ لِلْجِلادِ!
هَبِلَتْهُمُ الهَبُولُ! لَقَدْ كُنْتُ وَمَا أُهَدَّدُ بِالحَرْبِ،
وَلاَ أُرَهَّبُ بِالضَّرْبِ! وَإِنِّي لَعَلَى يَقِينٍ مِنْ رَبِّي،
وَغَيْرِ شُبْهَةٍ مِنْ دِيني.

[^1]: When Amir al-mu'minin was accused of \`Uthman's assassination he
delivered this sermon to refute that allegation, wherein he says about
those who blamed him that: "These seekers of vengeance cannot say that I
alone am the assassin and that no one else took part in it. Nor can they
falsify witnessed events by saying that they were unconcerned with it.
Why then have they put me foremost for this avenging? With me they
should include themselves also. If I am free of this blame they cannot
establish their freedom from it. How can they detach themselves from
this punishment? The truth of the matter is that by accusing me of this
charge their aim is that I should behave with them in the same manner to
which they are accustomed. But they should not expect from me that I
would revive the innovations of the previous regimes. As for fighting,
neither was I ever afraid of it nor am I so now. Allah knows my
intention and He also knows that those standing on the excuse of taking
revenge are themselves his assassins." Thus, history corroborates that
the people who managed his (\`Uthman's) assassination by agitation and
had even prevented his burial in Muslims' graveyard by hurling stones at
his coffin were the same who rose for avenging his blood. In this
connection, the names of Talhah ibn \`Ubaydillah, az-Zubayr ibn
al-\`Awwam and \`A'ishah are at the top of the list since on both
occasions their efforts come to sight with conspicuity. Thus Ibn
Abi'l-Hadid writes that: Those who have written the account of
assassination of \`Uthman state that on the day of his killing Talhah's
condition was that in order to obscure himself from the eyes of the
people he had a veil on his face and was shooting arrows at \`Uthman's
house. And in this connection, about az-Zubayr's ideas he writes:
Historians have also state that az-Zubayr used to say "Kill \`Uthman. He
has altered your faith." People said, "Your son is standing at his door
and guarding him," and he replied, "Even my son may be lost, but
\`Uthman must be killed. \`Uthman will be lying like a carcass on Sirat
tomorrow." (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol.9, pp. 35-36) About \`A'ishah,
Ibn \`Abd Rabbih writes: al-Mughirah ibn Shu\`bah came to \`A'ishah when
she said, "O' Abu \`Abdillah, I wish you had been with me on the day of
Jamal; how arrows were piercing through my hawdaj (camel litter) till
some of them stuck my body." al- Mughirah said, "I wish one of them
should have killed you." She said, "Allah may have pity you; why so?" He
replied, "So that it would have been some atonement for what you had
done against \`Uthman." (al-\`Iqd al-farid, vol. 4, p. 294)
