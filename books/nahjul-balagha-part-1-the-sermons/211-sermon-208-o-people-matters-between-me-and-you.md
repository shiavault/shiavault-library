Sermon 208: O people, matters between me and you….
==================================================

When Amir al-mu'minin's companions expressed displeasure about his
attitude concerning Arbitration, [^1] he said:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قاله لمّا اضطرب عليه أصحابه في أمر الحكومة
  </p>
</blockquote>

O people, matters between me and you went as I wished till war exhausted
you. By Allah, it has overtaken some of you and left others, and has
completely weakened your enemy. Till yesterday I was giving orders but
today I am being given orders, and till yesterday I was dissuading
people (from wrong acts) but today I am being dissuaded. You have now
shown liking to live in this world, and it is not for me to bring you to
what you dislike.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إِنَّهُ لَمْ يَزَلْ أَمْري مَعَكُمْ عَلَى مَا
أُحِبُّ، حَتَّى نَهَكَتْكُمُ الْحَرْبُ، وَقَدْ، وَاللهِ أَخَذَتْ
مِنْكُمْ وَتَرَكَتْ، وَهِيَ لِعَدُوِّكُمْ أَنْهَكُ. لَقَدْ كُنْتُ
أَمْسِ أَمِيراً، فَأَصْبَحْتُ الْيَوْمَ مَأْمُوراً! وَكُنْتُ أَمْسِ
نَاهِياً، فَأَصْبَحْتُ الْيَوْمَ مَنْهِيّاً! وَقَدْ أَحْبَبْتُمُ
الْبَقَاءَ، وَلَيْسَ لِي أَنْ أَحْمِلَكُمْ عَلَى مَا تَكْرَهُونَ!
  </p>

[^1]: When the surviving forces of the Syrians lost ground and were
ready to run away from the field Mu\`awiyah changed the whole phase of
the battle by using the Qur'an as his instrument of strategy, and
succeeded in creating such a division among the Iraqis that, despite
Amir al-mu'minin's efforts at counselling, they were not prepared to
take any forward step, but insisted on stopping the war, whereupon Amir
al-mu'minin too had to agree to arbitration. Among these people some had
actually been duped and believed that they were being asked to abide by
the Qur'an but there were others who had become weary of the long period
of war and had lost courage. Then people got a good opportunity to stop
the war, and so they cried hoarse for its postponement. There were
others who had accompanied Amir al-mu'minin because of his temporal
authority but did not support him by heart, nor did they aim at victory
for him. There were some people who had expectations with Mu\`awiyah,
and had started attaching hopes to him for this, while there were some
who were, from the very beginning, in league with him. In these
circumstances and with this type of the army it was really due to Amir
al-mu'minin's political ability and competence of military control and
administration that he carried the war up to this stage, and if
Mu\`awiyah had not adopted this trick there could have been no doubt in
Amir al-mu'minin's victory because the military power of the Syrian
forces had been exhausted and defeat was hovering over its head. In this
connection, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes: Malik al-Ashtar had reached
Mu\`awiyah and grabbed him by the neck. The entire might of the Syrians
had been smashed. Only so much movement was discernible in them as
remains in the tail of a lizard which is killed, but the tail continues
hopping right and left. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 11, pp.30-31)
