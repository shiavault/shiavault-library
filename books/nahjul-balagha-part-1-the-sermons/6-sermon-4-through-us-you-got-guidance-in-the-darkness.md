Sermon 4: Through us you got guidance in the darkness...
========================================================

*Amir al-mu’minin’s far-sightedness and his staunch conviction in
Belief*

Through us you got guidance in the darkness and secured high position,
and through us you got out of the gloomy night. The ears which do not
listen to the cries may become deaf. How can one who remained deaf to
the loud cries (of the Qur’an and the Prophet) listen to (my) feeble
voice? The heart that has ever palpitated (with fear of Allah) may get
peace.

بِنَا اهْتَدَيْتُمْ في الظَّلْمَاءِ، وَتَسَنَّمْتُمُ العلْيَاءَ،
وبِنَا انْفَجَرْتُم عَنِ السِّرَارِ، وُقِرَ سَمْعٌ لَمْ يَفْقَهِ
الوَاعِيَةَ، كَيْفَ يُرَاعِي النَّبْأَةَ مَنْ أَصَمَّتْهُ الصَّيْحَةُ؟
رُبِطَ جَنَانٌ لَمْ يُفَارِقْهُ الخَفَقَانُ.

I always apprehended from you consequences of treachery and I had seen
you through in the garb of the deceitful. The curtain of religion had
kept me hidden from you but the truth of my intentions disclosed you to
me. I stood for you on the path of truth among misleading tracks where
you met each other but there was no leader and you dug but got no water.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا زِلتُ أَنْتَظِرُ بِكُمْ عَوَاقِبَ الغَدْرِ، وَأَتَوَسَّمُكُمْ
بِحِلْيَةِ الـمُغْتَرِّينَ ، سَتَرَني عَنْكُمْ جِلْبَابُ الدِّينِ،
وَبَصَّرَنِيكُمْ صِدْقُ النِّيَّةِ، أَقَمْتُ لَكُمْ عَلَى سَنَنِ
الحَقِّ في جَوَادِّ الـمَضَلَّةِ، حيْثُ تَلْتَقُونَ وَلا دَلِيلَ،
وَتَحْتَفِرُونَ وَلا تُميِهُونَ.

Today I am making these dumb things speak to you (i.e. my suggestive
ideas and deep musings etc.) which are full of descriptive power. The
opinion of the person who abandons me may get astray. I have never
doubted in the truth since it has been shown to me. Musa (Moses)[^1] did
not entertain fear for his own self. Rather he apprehended mastery of
the ignorant and away of deviation. Today we stand on the cross-roads of
truth and untruth. The one who is sure of getting water feels no thirst.

  <p>
اليَوْمَ أُنْطِقُ لَكُمُ العَجْمَاءَ ذاتَ البَيَان! عَزَبَ رَأْيُ
امْرِىء تَخَلَّفَ عَنِّي، مَا شَكَكْتُ في الحَقِّ مُذْ أُرِيتُهُ! لَمْ
يُوجِسْ مُوسَى خِيفَةً عَلَى نَفْسِهِ، أَشْفَقَ مِنْ غَلَبَةِ
الجُهَّالِ وَدُوَلِ الضَّلالِ! اليَوْمَ تَوَاقَفْنَا عَلَى سَبِيلِ
الحَقِّ وَالباطِلِ، مَنْ وَثِقَ بِمَاء لَمْ يَظْمَأْ!

[^1]: The reference is to that event of Moses when sorcerers were sent
for to confront him and they showed their sorcery by throwing ropes and
sticks on the ground and Moses felt afraid. Thus, the Qur'an records: .
. it seemed to him (Moses), by their sorcery as if they were
running.Then Moses felt in himself a fear. We said: Fear not! Verily
thou art the uppermost. (20:66-68) Amir al-mu'minin says that the ground
for Moses’ fear was not that since he saw ropes and sticks moving he
might have entertained fear for his life but the cause of his fear was
lest people be impressed with this sorcery and get astray, and untruth
might prevail on account of this craft. That is why Moses was not
consoled by saying that his life was safe but by saying that he would
prove superior, and his claim would be upheld. Since his fear was for
the defeat of the truth and victory of the untruth, not for his own
life, the consideration was given to him for the victory of truth and
not for the protection of his life. Amir al-mu'minin also means that he
too had the same fear viz. that the people should not be caught in the
trap of these (Talhah, az-Zubayr, etc.) and fail into misguidance by
getting astray from the true faith. Otherwise, he himself never feared
for his own life.
