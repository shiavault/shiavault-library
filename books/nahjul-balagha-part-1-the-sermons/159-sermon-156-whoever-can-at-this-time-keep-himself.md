Sermon 156: Whoever can at this time keep himself….
===================================================

*About the malice borne by \`A'ishah; and warning the people of Basrah
about what was to occur*

<blockquote dir="rtl">

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
خاطب به أهل البصرة على جهة اقتصاص الملاحم
  </p>

Whoever can at this time keep himself clinging to Allah should do so. If
you follow me I shall certainly carry you, if Allah so wills, on the
path of Paradise, even though it may be full of severe hardship and of
bitter taste.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَمَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ عِنْدَ ذلِكَ أَنْ يَعْتَقِلَ نَفْسَهُ عَلَى اللهِ،
فَلْيَفْعَلْ، فَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوني فَإِنِّي حَامِلُكُمْ إِنْ شَاءَ
اللهُ عَلَى سَبِيلِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنْ كَانَ ذَا مَشَقَّة شَدِيدَة
وَمَذَاقَة مَرِيرَة.
  </p>
</blockquote>

As regards a certain woman,[^1] she is in the grip of womanly views, and
malice is boiling in her bosom like the furnace of the blacksmith. If
she were called upon to deal with others as she is dealing with me she
would not have done it. (As for me), even hereafter she will be allowed
her original respect, while the reckoning (of her misdeeds) is an
obligation on Allah.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

وَأَمَّا فُلاَنَةُ، فَأَدْرَكَهَا رَأْيُ الْنِّسَاءِ، وَضِغْنٌ غَلاَ
فِي صَدْرِهَا كَمِرْجَلِ الْقَيْنِ، وَلَوْ دُعِيَتْ لِتَنَالَ مِنْ
غَيْرِي مَا أَتَتْ إِلَيَّ، لَمْ تَفْعَلْ، وَلَهَا بَعْدُ حُرْمَتُهَا
الاْولَى، وَالْحِسَابُ عَلَى اللهِ.

A part of the same sermon: describing faith
-------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
منه: في وصف الايمان

This path is the lightest course and the brightest lamp. Guidance
towards virtuous actions is sought through faith while guidance towards
faith is achieved through virtuous actions. Knowledge is made to prosper
through faith, and death is feared because of knowledge. This world
comes to an end with death, while the next world is secured (by virtuous
actions) in this world. With the Day of Resurrection, Paradise is
brought near and **“*****hell will be brought into view for the
perverse”*** **(26:91)** For people there is no escape from
resurrection. They are heading for this last end in its appointed
course.

They have got up from the resting places in their graves and have set
off for the final objectives. Every house has its own people. They are
not changed nor shifted from there.

Commanding for good and refraining from evil are two characteristics of
Allah, the Glorified. They can neither bring death near nor lessen
sustenance.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

You should adhere to the Book of Allah because it is the strong rope, a
clear light, a benefiting cure, a quenching for thirst, protection for
the adherent and deliverance for the attached. It does not curve so as
to need straightening and does not deflect so as to be corrected.
Frequency of its repetition and its falling on ears does not make it
old. Whoever speaks according to it, speaks truth and whoever acts by it
is forward (in action).

**A man stood up and said:** O Amir al-mu'minin, tell us about this
disturbance and whether you enquired about it from the Holy Prophet.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقام إليه (عليه السلام) رجل فقال: أخبرنا عن الفتنة، وهل سألت عنها رسول
الله (صلى الله عليه وآله)؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Thereupon Amir al-mu'minin said**:

When Allah, the Glorified sent down the verse:

*Alif lam mim. What! Do people imagine that they will be let off on
(their) saying: "We believe!" and they will not be tried? (Qur'an,
29:1-2)*

I came to know that the disturbance would not befall us so long as the
Prophet (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and his progeny) is
among us.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقال (عليه السلام) : لَمَّا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ سُبْحَانَهُ، قَوْلَهُ :
(الم \* أحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَنْ يُتْركُوا أَنْ يَقُولُوا آمَنَّا وَهُمْ
لاَ يُفْتَنُونَ) عَلِمْتُ أَنَّ الْفِتْنَةَ لاَ تَنْزِلُ بِنَا
وَرَسُولُ اللهِ (صلى الله عليه وآله) بَيْنَ أَظْهُرِنَا.
  </p>
</blockquote>

So I said, "O Prophet of Allah, what is this disturbance of which Allah,
the Sublime, has informed you?" He replied, "O \`Ali, my people will
create trouble after me." I said, "O Prophet of Allah, on the day of
Uhud, when people had fallen martyrs and I was not among them, and that
was distressing for me, did you not say to me, 'cheer up, as martyrdom
is for you hereafter?'" The Prophet replied, "Yes it is so, but what
about your enduring at present?" I said, "O Prophet of Allah, this is
not an occasion for endurance, but rather an occasion for cheering up
and gratefulness."

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَقُلْتُ: يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ، مَا هذِهِ الْفِتْنَةُ الَّتي أَخْبَرَكَ
اللهُ بِهَا؟ فَقَالَ: يَا عَلِيُّ، إِنَّ أُمَّتِي سَيُفْتَنُونَ مِنْ
بَعْدِي. فَقُلْتُ: يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ، أَوَلَيْسَ قَدْ قُلْتَ لِي
يَوْمَ أُحُد حَيْثُ اسْتُشْهِدَ مَنِ اسْتُشْهِدَ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ،
وَحِيزَتْ عَنِّي الشَّهَادَةُ، فَشَقَّ ذلِكَ عَلَيَّ، فَقُلْتَ لِي:
«أَبْشِرْ، فَإِنَّ الشَّهَادَةَ مِنْ وَرَائِكَ»؟. فَقَالَ لي: «إِنَّ
ذلِكَ لَكَذلِكَ، فَكَيْفَ صَبْرُكَ إِذَنْ»؟. فَقُلْتُ: يَا رَسُولَ
اللهِ، لَيسَ هذَا مِنْ مَوَاطِنِ الصَّبْرِ، وَلكِنْ مِنْ مَوَاطِنِ
البشرى وَالشُّكُرِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Then he said: "O \`Ali, people will fall into mischief through their
wealth, will show obligation to Allah on account of their faith, will
expect His mercy, will feel safe from His anger and regard His unlawful
matters as lawful by raising false doubts and by their misguiding
desires. They will then hold lawful (the use of) wine by calling it
barley water, a bribe by calling it a gift, and taking of usurious
interest by calling it sale." I said, "O Prophet of Allah, how should I
deal with them at the time, whether to hold them to have gone back in
heresy or just in revolt." He said, "In revolt."

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَقَالَ: «يَا عَلِيُّ، إِنَّ الْقَوْمَ سَيُفْتَنُونَ بِأَمْوَالِهمْ،
وَيَمُنُّونَ بِدِينِهِم عَلَى رَبِّهِمْ، وَيَتَمَنَّوْنَ رَحْمَتَهُ،
وَيَأْمَنُونَ سَطْوَتَهُ، وَيَسْتَحِلُّونَ حَرَامَهُ بِالشُّبُهَاتِ
الْكَاذِبَةِ، وَالاْهْوَاءِ السَّاهِيَةِ، فَيَسْتَحِلُّونَ الْخَمْرَ
بِالنَّبِيذِ، وَالسُّحْتَ بِالْهَدِيَّةِ، وَالرِّبَا بِالْبَيْعِ».
قُلْتُ: يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ، فَبِأَيِّ الْمَنَازِلِ أُنْزِلُهُمْ عِنْدَ
ذلِكَ؟ أَبِمَنْزِلَةِ رِدَّة، أَمْ بِمَنْزِلَةِ فِتْنَة؟ فَقَالَ:
«بِمَنْزِلَةِ فِتْنَة».

[^1]: There is no denying the fact that \`A'ishah's behaviour towards
Amir al-mu'minin was throughout inimical, and very often her heart's
turbidity expressed itself on her face, and her hatred and dislike
became quite apparent, so much so that if in connection with some affair
Amir al-mu'minin's name came up a frown appeared on her forehead and she
did not relish pronouncing it with her tongue. For example, when
\`Ubaydullah ibn \`Abdillah ibn \`Utbah mentioned to \`Abdullah ibn
\`Abbas the narration by \`A'ishah namely that "in his death-illness the
Prophet, taking support on al-Fadl ibn \`Abbas and another person, came
to her (\`A'ishah's) house," \`Abdullah ibn \`Abbas said: "Do you know
who this 'other man' was?" He said, "No." Then he said, ' "\`Ali ibn Abi
Talib, but she is averse to name him in a good context." (Ahmad ibn
Hanbal, al-Musnad, vol. 6, pp. 34, 228; Ibn Sa\`d, at-Tabaqat al-Kabir,
vol. 2, part 2, p. 29; at-Tabari, at-Tarikh, vol. 1, pp. 1800-1801;
al-Baladhuri, Ansab al-ashraf, vol. 1, pp. 544-545; al-Bayhaqi, as-Sunan
al-kubra, vol. 3, p. 396). One cause for this hatred and malice was the
presence of Hadrat Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) whose wholesome dignity and esteem
pricked her heart like a thorn. Her jealousy towards the other wives (of
the Prophet) did not allow her to let the Prophet love the daughter of
his other wife to such a degree that he should stand on her approach,
seat her in his own place, declare her most honourable of all the women
of the world and bear such love towards her children as to call them his
own sons. All these things pained her much and naturally her feelings on
such an occasion were that if she had borne children they would have
been the Prophet's sons and they would have been the pivot of the
Prophet's affection instead of Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn. But she was
not gifted with any issue and she gratified her own desire to be a
mother by adopting the surname Umm \`Abdillah (mother of the slave of
Allah) after her sister's son. In short all these things created the
passion of hatred in her heart, as a result of which she off and on
complained to the Prophet against Hadrat Fatimah but could not succeed
in diverting the Prophet's attention from her. News about this
mortification and estrangement also reached the ears of Abu Bakr. That
would only perturb him as he too could do nothing, except that his
verbal sympathies were with his daughter. At last the Prophet left this
world and the reins of Government fell into his hands. Now was the
opportunity for him to avenge as best as he could and to perpetrate
whatever violence he had in mind. Consequently the first step he took
was that, in order to deprive Hadrat Fatimah of inheritance, he denied
the principle of inheritance in the case of the prophets and held that
neither do the prophets inherit nor are they inherited from, but the
property left by them escheats to the state. Fatimah was so much
affected that she gave up speaking to him and passed away from this
world with these very feelings. \`A'ishah did not even take the trouble
to express any sorrow at her tragic death. Thus Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has
written: When Fatimah expired, all the wives of the Prophet came to Bani
Hashim in condolence except \`A'ishah. She did not come and showed
herself sick and words from her reached \`Ali which displayed her joy.
(Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 9, p. 198). As long as she bore so much
malice against Hadrat Fatimah, how could Fatimah's spouse be spared
similar enmity and malice. Particularly when such events also occurred
which worked like a fan and roused her feeling of hatred, such as the
incident of "Ifk" when Amir al-mu'minin said to the Prophet: "She is no
better than the buckles of your shoe, leave her and divorce her away."
On hearing this \`A'ishah must have felt miserable in her bed, and must
have developed the severest feeling of hatred against him. There were
also moments when distinction was conferred on Amir al-mu'minin in
preference to Abu Bakr. For instance, in connection with the dispatch of
the Qur'anic verses on Bara'ah (innocence), the Prophet removed Abu Bakr
from the job, recalled him and assigned it to Amir al-mu'minin saying
that he had been commanded by Allah to take it himself or send it
through a member of his family. Similarly the Prophet closed all the
doors opening into the mosque including that of Abu Bakr but allowed the
door of Amir al-mu'minin's house to continue to open thereinto.
\`A'ishah could not relish Amir al-mu'minin's distinction over her
father, and whenever there was any occasion for such distinction she did
her best to undo it. When in his last days the Prophet ordered the
contingent under Usamah ibn Zayd to march, and ordered Abu Bakr and
\`Umar also to go under his command, they received a message from the
wives of the Prophet that his condition was serious and therefore the
contingent should come back instead of proceeding further. This was
because their far-reaching sight had realised that the only purpose in
getting Medina vacated by the muhajirun and the ansar could be that
after the death of the Prophet no one should stand in Amir al-mu'minin's
way and that he should get the caliphate without any trouble. On receipt
of this message the contingent under Usamah came back. When the Prophet
learnt this he again ordered Usamah to march with the contingent and
even said, "Allah may curse him who keeps away from the contingent,"
whereupon they again set off, but they were again called back till the
Prophet's illness assumed serious proportions, but Usamah's contingent
did not go out as it did not want to. After this Abu Bakr was sent word
through Bilal that he should deputise the Prophet in leading the prayers
in order to pave the way for his Caliphateship. Accordingly, keeping
this in view he was first shown as the Prophet's caliph (deputy) in
prayers and eventually was accepted as his caliph for all purposes.
Thereafter matters were so contrived that Amir al-mu'minin could not get
the Caliphate. However, after the reign of the third caliph
circumstances took such a turn that people were obliged to swear
allegiance at Amir al-mu'minin's hand. On this occasion \`A'ishah was
present in Mecca. When she learnt about Amir al-mu'minin's caliphate her
eyes began emitting flames, and rage and anger perturbed her mind, and
her hatred for Amir al-mu'minin assumed such seriousness that she rose
against him on the excuse of avenging blood of the same man (\`Uthman)
whom she had herself proclaimed fit to be killed, and openly declared
war as a result of which so much bloodshed occurred that the whole land
of Basrah was smeared with the blood of those killed, and the door of
disunity was opened for good. (Sharh, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol. 9, pp.
190-200).
