O people! Women are deficient in Faith, deficient in shares and
deficient in intelligence. As regards the deficiency in their Faith, it
is their abstention from prayers and fasting during their menstrual
period.

As regards deficiency in their intelligence it is because the evidence
of two women is equal to that of one man. As for the deficiency of their
shares that is because of their share in inheritance being half of men.
So beware of the evils of women. Be on your guard even from those of
them who are (reportedly) good. Do not obey them even in good things so
that they may not attract you to evils.

مَعَاشِرَ النَّاسِ، إِنَّ النِّسَاءَ نَوَاقِصُ الاْيمَانِ، نَوَاقِصُ
الْحُظُوظِ، نَوَاقِصُ الْعُقُولِ: فَأَمَّا نُقْصَانُ إِيمَانِهِنَّ
فَقُعُودُهُنَّ عَنِ الصَّلاةِ وَالصِّيَامِ فِي أَيَّامِ حَيْضِهِنَّ،
وَأَمَّا نُقْصَانُ عُقُولِهِنَّ فَشَهَادَةُ امْرَأَتَيْنِ مِنْهُنّ
كَشَهَادَةِ الرَّجُلِ الْوَاحِدِ، وَأَمَّا نُقْصَانُ حُظُوظِهِنَّ
فَمَوَارِيثُهُنَّ عَلَى الاْنْصَافِ مِنْ مَوارِيثِ الرِّجَالِ;
فَاتَّقُوا شِرَارَ النِّسَاءِ، وَكُونُوا مِنْ خِيَارِهِنَّ عَلَى
حَذَر، وَلاَتُطِيعُوهُنَّ فِي المَعْرُوفِ حَتَّى لاَ يَطْمَعْنَ فِي
المُنكَرِ.

[^1]: Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon after the devastation
created by the Battle of Jamal. Since the devastation resulting from
this battle was the outcome of blindly following a woman's command, in
this sermon he has described women's physical defects and their causes
and effects. Thus their first weakness is that for a few days in every
month they have to abstain from prayer and fasting, and this abstention
from worship is a proof of their deficiency in Faith. Although the real
meaning of \`iman (belief) is heart-felt testimony and inner conviction
yet metaphorically it also applies to action and character. Since
actions are the reflection of Belief they are also regarded as part of
Belief. Thus, it is related from Imam \`Ali ibn Musa ar-Rida (p.b.u.t.)
that: \`iman (belief) is testimony at heart, admission by the tongue and
action by the limbs. The second weakness is that their natural
propensities do not admit of full performance of their intelligence.
Therefore, nature has given them the power of intelligence only in
accordance with the scope of their activities which can guide them in
pregnancy, delivery, child nursing, child care and house-hold affairs.
On the basis of this weakness of mind and intelligence their evidence
has not been accorded the status of man's evidence, as Allah says: . . .
then call to witness two witnesses from among your men and if there not
be two men then (take) a man and two women, of those ye approve of the
witnesses, so that should one of the two (women) forget the (second) one
of the two may remind the other... (Qur'an, 2:282) The third weakness is
that their share in inheritance is half of man's share in inheritance as
the Qur'an says: Allah enjoineth you about your children. The male shall
have the equal of the shares of two females...(4:11) This shows woman's
weakness because the reason for her share in inheritance being half is
that the liability of her maintenance rests on man. When man's position
is that of a maintainer and care taker the status of the weaker sex who
is in need of maintenance and care-taking is evident. After describing
their natural weakness, Amir al-mu'minin points out the mischief of
blindly following them and wrongly obeying them. He says that not to say
of bad things but even if they say in regard to some good things it
should not be done in a way that these should feel as if it is being
done in pursuance of their wish, but rather in a way that they should
realise that the good act has been performed because of its being good
and that their pleasure or wish has nothing to do with it. If they have
even the doubt that their pleasures has been kept in view in it they
would slowly increase in their demands and would wish that they should
be obeyed in all matters however evil, the inevitable consequence
whereof will be destruction and ruin. ash-Shaykh Muhammad \`Abduh writes
about this view of Amir al-mu'minin as under: Amir al-mu'minin has said
a thing which is corroborated by experiences of centuries.
