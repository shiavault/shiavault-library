Sermon 220: How distant (from achievement) is their aim….
=========================================================

Amir al-mu'minin recited the verse:

***Engage (your) vying in exuberance, until ye come to the graves.***
[^1] ***(Qur'an, 102:1-2)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال بعد تلاوته: (ألهاكُمُ التَّكاثُر \* حَتَّى زُرتُمُ المَقابِرَ)
  </p>
</blockquote>

Then he said:  
 How distant (from achievement) is their aim, how neglectful are these
visitors and how difficult is the affair. They have not taken lessons
from things which are full of lessons, but they took them from far off
places. Do they boast on the dead bodies of their fore-fathers, or do
they regard the number of dead persons as a ground for feeling boastful
of their number? They want to revive the bodies that have become
spiritless and the movements that have ceased. They are more entitled to
be a source of lesson than a source of pride. They are more suitable for
being a source of humility than of honour.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا لَهُ مَرَاماً مَا أَبْعَدَهُ! وَزَوْراً مَا أَغْفَلَهُ! وَخطراً
مَا أَفْظَعَهُ! لَقَدِ اسْتَخْلَوْا مِنْهُمْ أَيَّ مُذّكر،
وَتَنَاوَشُوهُمْ مِنْ مَكَان بَعِيد! أَفَبِمَصَارِعِ آبَائِهِمْ
يَفْخَرُونَ! أَمْ بِعَدِيدِ الْهَلْكَى يَتَكَاثَرُونَ! يَرْتَجِعُونَ
مِنْهُمْ أَجْسَاداً خَوَتْ، وَحَرَكَات سَكَنَتْ، وَلاَنْ يَكُونُوا
عِبَراً، أَحَقُّ مِنْ أَنْ يَكُونُوا مُفْتَخَراً، وَلاَن يَهْبِطُوا
بِهِمْ جَنَابَ ذِلَّة، أَحْجَى مِنْ أَنْ يَقُوموُا بِهِمْ مَقَامَ
عِزَّة!

They looked at them with weak-sighted eyes and descended into the hollow
of ignorance. If they had asked about them from the dilapidated houses
and empty courtyards, they would have said that they went into the earth
in the state of misguidance and you too are heading ignorantly towards
them. You trample their skulls, want to raise constructions on their
corpses, you graze what they have left and live in houses which they
have vacated. The days (that lie) between them and you are also
bemoaning you and reciting elegies over you.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لَقَدْ نَظَرُوا إِلَيْهِمْ بِأَبْصَارِ الْعَشْوَةِ، وَضَرَبُوا

عَرَصَاتِ تِلْكَ الدِّيَارِ الْخَاوِيَةِ، وَالْرُّبُوعِ الْخَالِيَةِ،
لَقَالَتْ: ذَهَبُوا فِي الاْرْضِ ضُلاَّلاً، وَذَهَبْتُمْ فِي
أَعْقَابِهِمْ جُهَّالاً، تَطَأُونَ فِي هَامِهِمْ، وَتَسْتَنْبِتُونَ

They are your fore-runners in reaching the goal and have arrived at the
watering places before you. They had positions of honour and plenty of
pride. They were rulers and holders of positions. Now they have gone
into the interstice where earth covers them from above and is eating
their flesh and drinking their blood. They lie in the hollows of their
graves lifeless, no more growing, and hidden, not to be found. The
approach of dangers does not frighten them, and the adversity of
circumstances does not grieve them. They do not mind earthquakes, nor do
they pay heed to thunders. They are gone and not expected back. They are
existent but unseen. They were united but are now dispersed. They were
friendly and are now separated.

Their accounts are unknown and their houses are silent, not because of
length of time or distance of place, but because they have been made to
drink the cup (of death) which has changed their speech into dumbness,
their hearing into deafness and their movements into stillness. It seems
as though they are fallen in slumber. They are neighbours not feeling
affection for each other, or friends who do not meet each other. The
bonds of their knowing each other have been worn out and the connections
of their friendship have been cut asunder.

Everyone of them is therefore alone although they are a group, and they
are strangers, even though friends. They are unaware of morning after a
night and of evening after a day. The night or the day when they
departed has become ever existent for them. [^2] They found the dangers
of their placed of stay more serious than they had apprehended, and they
witnessed that its signs were greater than they had guessed. The two
objectives (namely paradise and hell) have been stretched for them upto
a point beyond the reach of fear or hope. Had they been able to speak
they would have become dumb to describe what they witnessed or saw.

Even though their traces have been wiped out and their news has stopped
(circulating), eyes are capable of drawing a lesson, as they looked at
them, ears of intelligence heard them and they spoke without uttering
words. So, they said that handsome faces have been destroyed and
delicate bodies have been smeared with earth. We have put on a worn-out
shroud. The narrowness of the grave has overwhelmed us and strangeness
has spread among us. Our silent abodes have been ruined. The beauty of
our bodies has disappeared. Our known features have become hateful. Our
stay in the places of strangeness has become long. We do not get relief
from pain, nor widening from narrowness.

Now. if you portray them in your mind, or if the curtains concealing
them are removed from them for you, in this state when their ears have
lost their power and turned deaf, their eyes have been filled with dust
and sunk down, their tongues which were very active have been cut into
pieces, their hearts which were ever wakeful have become motionless in
their chests, in every limb of theirs a peculiar decay has occurred
which has deformed it, and has paved the way for calamity towards it,
all these lie powerless, with no hand to help them and no heart to
grieve over them, (then) you would certainly notice the grief of (their)
hearts and the dirt of (their) eyes.

Every trouble of theirs is such that its position does not change and
the distress does not clear away. How many a prestigious body and
amazing beauty the earth has swallowed, although when in the world he
enjoyed abundant pleasures and was nurtured in honour. He clung to
enjoyments (even) in the hour of grief. If distress befell him he sought
refuge in consolation (derived) through the pleasures of life and
playing and games.

While he was laughing at the world and the world was laughing at him in
his life full of forgetfulness, time trampled him like thorns, the days
weakened his energy and death began to look at him from near. Then he
was overtaken by a grief which he had never felt, and ailments appeared
in place of the health he had previously possessed.

He then turned to that with which the physician had made him familiar,
namely suppressing the hot (diseases) with cold (medicines) and curing
the cold with hot doses, but the cold things did nothing save aggravate
the hot ailments, while the hot ones did nothing except increasing the
coldness. Nor did he acquire temperateness in his constitution but
rather every ailment of his increased till his physicians became
helpless, his attendants grew neglectful and his own family lacked the
ablility to describe his disease, and were unable to answer those who
enquired about him.

They disputed in front of him about the serious news which they were
concealing from him. Thus, someone would say "his condition is what it
is" and would console them with hopes of his recovery, while another one
would advocate patience on missing him, recalling to them the calamities
that had befallen the earlier generations.

In this state when he was getting ready to depart from the world and
leave his beloved ones, such a serious choking overtook him that his
senses became bewildered and the dampness of his tongue dried up. Now,
there was many an important question whose reply he knew about he could
not utter it, and many a voice that was painful for his heart that he
heard but remained (unmoved) as though he was deaf to the voice of
either an elder whom he used to respect or of a younger whom he used to
caress. The pangs of death are too hideous to be covered by description
or to be appreciated by the hearts of the people in this world.

[^1]: The genesis of the descending of this verse is that the tribes of
Banu \`Abd Manaf and Banu Sahm began to boast against each other over
the abundance of their wealth and the number of their tribesmen, and in
order to prove they had a greater number each one began to include their
dead as well, whereupon this verse was revealed to the effect that
abundance of riches and majority in numbers has made you so forgetful
that you count the dead also with the living. This verse is also taken
to mean that abundance of riches and progeny has made you forgetful till
you reached the graves, but the utterance of Amir al-mu'minin supports
the first meaning.

[^2]: This means that for him he who dies in the day it is always day
whereas for him who dies in the night the darkness of night never
dispels, because they are at a place where there is no turning of the
moon and the sun and no rotation of the nights and the days. The same
meaning has been expressed by a poet like this: There is sure to be a
day without a night, Or a night that would come without a day.
