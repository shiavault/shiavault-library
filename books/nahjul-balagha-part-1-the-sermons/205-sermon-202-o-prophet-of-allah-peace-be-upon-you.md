Sermon 202: O Prophet of Allah, peace be upon you…
==================================================

*What Amir al-mu'minin said on the occasion of the burial of
Sayyidatu'n-nisa' (Supreme lady) Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) while addressing the
Holy Prophet at his grave.*

O Prophet of Allah, peace be upon you from me and from your daughter who
has come to you and who has hastened to meet you. O Prophet of Allah, my
patience about your chosen (daughter) has been exhausted, and my power
of endurance has weakened, except that I have ground for consolation in
having endured the great hardship and heart-rending event of your
separation. I laid you down in your grave when your last breath had
passed (when your head was) between my neck and chest.

***... Verily we are Allah's and verily unto Him shall we return.***
**(Qur'an 2:156)**

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ عَنِّي، وَعَنِ ابْنَتِكَ
النَّازِلَةِ فِي جِوَارِكَ، وَالسَّرِيعَةِ اللَّحَاقِ بِكَ! قَلَّ يَا
رَسُولَ اللهِ، عَنْ صَفِيَّتِكَ صَبْرِي، وَرَقَّ عَنْهَا تَجَلُّدِي،
إِلاَّ أَنَّ لِي فِي التَّأَسِّيِ بِعَظِيمِ فُرْقَتِكَ، وَفَادِحِ
مُصِيبَتِكَ، مَوْضِعَ تَعَزّ، فَلَقَدْ وَسَّدْتُكَ فِي مَلْحُودَةِ
قَبْرِكَ، وَفَاضَتْ بَيْنَ نَحْرِي وَصَدْرِي نَفْسُكَ. (إنَّا لله
وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ).
  </p>
</blockquote>

Now. the trust has been returned and what had been given has been taken
back. As to my grief, it knows no bounds, and as to my nights. They will
remain sleepless till Allah chooses for me the house in which you are
now residing.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَلَقَدِ اسْتُرْجِعَتِ الْوَدِيعَةُ، وَأُخِذَتِ الرَّهِينَةُ! أَمَّا
حُزْنِي فَسَرْمَدٌ، وَأَمَّا لَيْلِي فَمُسَهَّدٌ، إِلَى أَنْ يَخْتَارَ
اللهُ لِي دَارَكَ الَّتِي أَنْتَ بِهَا مُقِيمٌ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Certainly, your daughter would apprise you of the joining together of
your [^1] *ummah* (people) for oppressing her. You ask her in detail and
get all the news about the position. This has happened when a long time
had not elapsed and your remembrance had not disappeared. My *salam*
(salutation) be on you both, the salutation of one bidding farewell,
neither in aversion nor in dislike, for if I go away it is not because I
am weary (of you), and if I stay it is not due to lack of belief in what
Allah has promised the endurers.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَسَتُنَبِّئُكَ ابْنَتُكَ بِتَضَافُرِ أُمَّتِكَ عَلَى هَضْمِهَا،
فَأَحْفِهَا السُّؤَالَ، وَاسْتَخْبِرْهَا الْحَالَ، هذَا وَلَمْ يَطُلِ
الْعَهْدُ، وَلَمْ يَخْلُ مِنْكَ الذِّكْرُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَالْسَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمَا سَلاَمَ مُوَدِّع، لاَ قَال وَلاَ سَئم، فَإنْ
أَنْصَرِفْ فَلاَ عَنْ مَلاَلَة، وَإِنْ أُقِمْ فَلاَ عَنْ سُوءِ ظَنٍّ
بِمَا وَعَدَ اللهُ الصَّابِرِينَ.
  </p>

[^1]: The treatment meted out to the daughter of the Prophet after his
death was extremely painful and sad. Although Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah
(p.b.u.h.) did not live in this world more than a few months after the
death of the Prophet yet even this short period has a long tale of grief
and woe (about her). In this connection, the first scene that strikes
the eyes is that arrangements for the funeral rites of the Prophet had
not yet been made when the contest for power started in the Saqifah of
Banu Sa\`idah. Naturally, their leaving the body of the Prophet (without
burial) must have injured Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah's grief-stricken
heart when she saw that those who had claimed love and attachment (with
the Prophet) during his life became so engrossed in their machinations
for power that instead of consoling his only daughter they did not even
know when the Prophet was given a funeral ablution and when he was
buried, and the way they condoled her was that they crowded at her house
with material to set fire to it and tried to secure allegiance by force
with all the display of oppression, compulsion and violence. All these
excesses were with a view to so obliterate the prestigious position of
this house that it might not regain its lost prestige on any occasion.
With this aim in view, in order to crush her economic position, her
claim for (the estate of) Fadak was turned down by dubbing it as false,
the effect of which was that Sayyidatu'n-nisa' Fatimah (p.b.u.h.) made
the dying will that none of them should attend her funeral.
