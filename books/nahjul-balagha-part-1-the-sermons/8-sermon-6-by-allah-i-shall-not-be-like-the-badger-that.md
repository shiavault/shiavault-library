By Allah, I shall not be like the badger, that feigns sleep on
continuous (sound of) stone-throwing till he who is in search of it
finds it or he who is on the look out for it overpowers it. Rather, I
shall ever strike the deviators from truth with the help of those who
advance towards it, and the sinners and doubters with the help of those
who listen to me and obey, till my day (of death) comes. By Allah I have
been continually deprived of my right, with others being given
preference to me, from the day the Prophet died till today.

وَاللهِ لاَ أَكُونُ كالضَّبُعِ: تَنَامُ عَلى طُولِ اللَّدْمِ، حَتَّى
يَصِلَ إِلَيْهَا طَالِبُهَا،وَيَخْتِلَهَا رَاصِدُها، وَلكِنِّي
أَضْرِبُ بِالمُقْبِلِ إِلَى الحَقِّ المُدْبِرَ عَنْهُ، وَبِالسَّامِعِ
المُطِيعِ العَاصِيَ المُريبَ أَبَداً، حَتَّى يَأْتِيَ عَلَيَّ يَوْمِي.
فَوَاللهِ مَا زِلتُ مَدْفُوعاً عَنْ حَقِّي، مُسْتَأْثَراً عَلَيَّ،
مُنْذُ قَبَضَ اللهُ تعالى نَبِيَّهُ (صلى الله عليه وآله) حَتَّى يَوْمِ
النَّاسِ هذَا.

[^1]: When Amir al-mu'minin showed intention to chase Talhah and
az-Zubayr, he was advised to leave them on their own lest he received
some harm from them. Amir al-mu'minin uttered these words in reply, the
sum total whereof is: "How long can I be a mere spectator to my right
being snatched and keep quiet. Now, so long as I have breath of life I
shall fight them and make them suffer the consequences of their conduct.
They should not think that I can be easily over-powered like the
badger." Dabu\` means badger. Its nickname is Umm \`Amir and Umm
Turrayq. It is also called "the glutton", because it swallows everything
and eats up whatever it gets as if several bellies were contained in
one, and they do not have their fill. It is also called Na\`thal. It is
a very simple and silly animal. Its slyness is apparent from the way it
is easily caught. It is said that the hunter surrounds its den and
strikes it with his foot or a stick, and calls out softly, "Bow you head
Umm Turrayq, conceal yourself Umm \`Amir." On repeating this sentence
and patting the ground, it conceals itself in a corner of the den. Then
the hunter says, "Umm \`Amir is not in its den, it is sleeping." On
hearing this it stretches its limbs and feigns sleep. The hunter then
puts the knot in its feet and drags it out, and if falls like a coward
into his hand without resistance.
