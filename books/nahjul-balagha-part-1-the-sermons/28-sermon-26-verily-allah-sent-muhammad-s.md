Verily, Allah sent Muhammad (S) as a warner (against vice) for all the
worlds and a trustee of His revelation, while you people of Arabia were
following the worst religion and you resided among rough stones and
venomous serpents. You drank dirty water and ate filthy food. You shed
blood of each other and cared not for relationship. Idols are fixed
among you and sins are clinging to you.

انَّ اللهَ سُبحانَه بَعَثَ مُحَمَّداً نَذِيراً لِلْعَالَمِينَ،
وَأَمِيناً عَلَى التَّنْزِيلِ، وَأَنْتُمْ مَعْشَرَ العَرَبِ عَلَى
شَرِّ دِينٍ، وَفِي شَرِّ دَارٍ، مُنِيخُونَ بَيْنَ حِجارَةٍ خُشْنٍ
وَحَيَّاتٍ صُمٍّ تشْرَبُونَ الكَدِرَ، وَتَأْكُلُونَ الجَشِبَ
وَتَسْفِكُونَ دِمَاءَكُمْ، وَتَقْطَعُونَ أَرْحَامَكُمْ، الاْصْنَامُ
فِيكُمْ مَنْصُوبَةٌ، وَالاْثَامُ بِكُمْ مَعْصُوبَةٌ

Part of the same sermon in describing his condition before allegiance was paid to him (after the death of the Holy Prophet)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I looked and found that there is no supporter for me except family, so I
refrained from thrusting them unto death. I kept my eyes closed despite
motes in them. I drank despite choking of throat. I exercised patience
despite trouble in breathing and despite having to take sour colocynth
as food.

فَضَنِنْتُ بِهمْ عَنِ المَوْتِ، وَأَغْضَيْتُ عَلَى القَذَى، وَشَرِبْتُ
عَلَى الشَّجَا وَصَبَرْتُ عَلَى أَخْذِ الكَظَمِ، وَعَلىْ أَمَرَّ مِنْ
طَعْمِ العَلْقَمِ.

Part of the same sermon on the settlement between Mu\`awiyah and \`Amr ibn al-\`As
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He did not swear allegiance till he got him to agree that he would pay
him its price. The hand of this purchaser (of allegiance) may not be
successful and the contract of the seller may face disgrace. Now you
should take up arms for war and arrange equipment for it. Its flames
have grown high and its brightness has increased. Clothe yourself with
patience for it is the best to victory.[^1]

(5) al-Kulayni, *al-Rasa'il,* mentioned by Ibn Tawus, *op. cit.*

[^1]: Amir al-mu'minin had delivered a sermon before setting off for
Nahrawan. These are three parts from it. In the first part he has
described the condition of Arabia before Proclamation (of Prophethood);
in the second he has referred to circumstances which forced him to keep
quiet and in the third he has described the conversation and settlement
between Mu\`awiyah and \`Amr ibn al-\`As. The position of this mutual
settlement was that when Amir al-mu'minin sent Jarir ibn \`Abdillah
al-Bajali to Mu\`awiyah to secure his allegiance he detained Jarir under
the excuse of giving a reply, and in the meantime he began exploring how
far the people of Syria would support him. When he succeeded in making
them his supporters by rousing them to avenge \`Uthman's blood he
consulted his brother \`Utbah ibn Abi Sufyan. He suggested, "If in this
matter \`Amr ibn al-\`As was associated he would solve most of the
difficulties through his sagacity, but he would not be easily prepared
to stabilise your authority unless he got the price he desired for it.
If you are ready for this he would prove the best counsellor and
helper." Mu\`awiyah liked this suggestion, sent for \`Amr ibn al-\`As
and discussed with him, and eventually it was settled that he would
avenge \`Uthman's blood by holding Amir al-mu'minin liable for it in
exchange for the governorship of Egypt, and by whatever means possible
would not let Mu\`awiyah's authority in Syria suffer. Consequently, both
of them fulfilled the agreement and kept their words fully.
