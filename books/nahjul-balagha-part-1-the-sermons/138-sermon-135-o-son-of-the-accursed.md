Sermon 135: O son of the accursed…..
====================================

There was some exchange of words between \`Uthman ibn \`Affan and Amir
al-mu'minin when al-Mughirah ibn al-Akhnas [^1] said to \`Uthman that he
would deal with Amir al-mu'minin on his behalf whereupon Amir
al-mu'minin said to al-Mughirah:

  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقد وقعت مشاجرة بينه وبين عثمان، فقال المغيرة بن الاخنس لعثمان: أنا
أكِفيكَه، فقال أميرالمؤمنين صلوات الله عليه للمغيرة:
  </p>
</blockquote>

O son of the accursed and issueless, and of a tree which has neither
root nor branch. Will you deal with me? By Allah, Allah will not grant
victory to him whom you support, nor will he be able to stand up whom
you raise. Get away from us. Allah may keep you away from your purpose.
Then do whatever you like. Allah may not have mercy on you if you have
pity on me.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَابْنَ اللَّعِينِ الاْبْتَرِ، وَالشَّجَرَةِ الَّتي لاَ أَصْلَ لَهَا
وَلاَ فَرْعَ، أَنْتَ تَكْفِينِي، فَوَاللهِ مَاأَعَزَّ اللهُ مَنْ
أَنْتَ نَاصِرُهُ، وَلاَ قَامَ مَنْ أَنْتَ مُنْهِضُه، اخْرُجْ عَنَّا
أَبْعَدَ اللهُ نَوَاكَ، ثُمَّ ابْلُغْ جَهْدَك، فَلاَ أَبْقَى اللهُ
عَلَيْكَ إِنْ أَبْقَيْتَ!

(1) Ibn A\`tham al-Kufi, *al-Futuh,* II, 165.

[^1]: Al-Mughirah ibn al-Akhnas ath-Thaqafi was among the wellwishers of
\`Uthman ibn \`Affan and the son of his paternal aunt. His brother Abu'l
Hakam ibn al-Akhnas was killed at the hands of Amir al-mu'minin in the
battle of Uhud, because of which he bore malice against Amir
al-mu'minin. His father was one of those people who accepted Islam at
the time of the fall of Mecca but retained heresy and hypocrisy in
heart. That is why Amir al-mu'minin called him accursed, and he called
him issueless because he who has a son like al-Mughirah deserves to be
called issueless.
