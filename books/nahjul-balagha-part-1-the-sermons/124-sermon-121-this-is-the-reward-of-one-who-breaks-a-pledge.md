Sermon 121: This is the reward of one who breaks a pledge….
===========================================================

*After Laylatu’l Harir (in Siffin)*

A man from among the companions of Amir al-mu'minin stood up and said,
"O Amir al-mu'minin, you first stopped us from Arbitration and
thereafter gave order for it. We do not know which of these two was more
appropriate." Amir al-mu'minin struck one hand over the other and said:

وقد قام رجل من أصحابه فقال: نهيتنا عن الحكومة ثمّ أمرتنا بها، فما ندري
أيّ الامرين أَرشد؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فصفق(عليه السلام) إحدى يديه على الاخرى ثمّ قال:
  </p>
</blockquote>

This is the reward of one who breaks a pledge. By Allah, when I gave you
my orders (namely) to abide by arbitration I had led you to an
undesirable thing (namely war) in which Allah had ordained good. If you
had been steadfast I would have guided you, if you had been bent I would
have straightened you and if you had refused I would have rectified you.
This was the surest way. But with whom and to whom? I wanted my
treatment from you but you proved to be my disease, like the extractor
of thorn with the thorn when he knows that the thorn bends towards
itself.

My God, the physicians have despaired of this fatal ailment and
water-drawers have become tired with the rope of this well.

أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِما أَمَرْتُكُمْ بِهِ حَمَلْتُكُمْ عَلَى الْمَكْرُوهِ
الَّذِي يَجْعَلُ اللهُ فِيهِ خَيْراً، فَإِنِ اسْتَقَمْتُمْ
هَدَيْتُكُمْ وَإِنِ اعْوَجَجْتُمْ قَوَّمْتُكُمْ وَإِنْ أَبَيْتُمْ
تَدَارَكْتُكُمْ، لَكَانَتِ الْوُثْقَى، وَلكِنْ بِمَنْ وَإِلَى مَنْ؟
أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُدَاوِيَ بِكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ دَائي، كَنَاقِشِ الشَّوْكَةِ
بِالشَّوْكَةِ، وَهُوَ يَعْلَمُ أَنَّ ضَلْعَهَا مَعَهَا!

Where [^1] are those who were invited to Islam and they accepted it?
They read the Qur'an and decided according to it. They were exhorted to
fight and they leapt (towards it) as she-camels leap towards their
young. They took their swords out of the sheaths and went out into the
world in groups and rows. Some of them perished and some survived. The
good news of survival does not please them nor do they get condoled
about the dead. Their eyes have turned white with weeping. Their bellies
are emaciated because of fasting. Their lips are dry because of
(constant) praying. Their colour is pale because of wakefulness. Their
faces bear the dust of God-fearing. These are my comrades who have
departed. We should be justified if we feel eager for them and bite our
hands in their separation.

فَوَلَّهُوا اللِّقَاحَ أَوْلاَدَهَا، وَسَلَبُوا السُّيُوفَ

Certainly, Satan has made his ways easy for you and wants to unfasten
the knots of religion one by one and to cause division among you in
place of unity. Keep away from his evil ideas and enchantments and
accept good advice of one who offers it to you and preserve it in your
minds.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ يُسَنِّي لَكُمْ طُرُقَهُ، وَيُرِيدُ أَنْ يَحُلَّ
دِينَكُمْ عُقْدَةً عُقْدَةً، وَيُعْطِيَكُمْ بَالْجَمَاعَةِ
الْفُرْقَةَ، وَبِالْفُرْقَةِ الْفَتْنَةَ; فَاصْدِفُوا عَنْ نَزَغَاتِهِ
وَنَفَثَاتِهِ، وَاقْبَلُوا النَّصِيحَةَ مِمَّنْ أَهْدَاهَا إِلَيْكُمْ،
وَاعْقِلوهَا عَلَى أَنْفُسِكُمْ.

[^1]: Although all those who fought under the banner of Amir al-mu'minin
were called Shi\`ahs of \`Ali, yet only those who had tears in their
eyes, paleness on their faces, the Qur'anic verses on their tongues,
zeal of religion in their hearts, steadfastness in their feet,
determination and courage in their spirits, and patience and endurance
in their minds could in true sense he called Shi\`ahs of \`AIi. These
were the people in whose separation Amir al-mu'minin's feelings were
coming out in the shape of sighs through the breath, while the flames of
the fire of separation were consuming his heart and spirit. These were
the people who leapt towards death like mad men and did not feel happy
if they survived. Rather, their heart's slogan was as the Persian
hemistich says: We are ashamed why we have remained alive. He who has
even a slight brilliance of these qualities can alone be called the
follower of the Descendants of the Prophet or the Shi\`ah of \`Ali,
otherwise it would be a word which has lost its meaning and been bereft
of its dignity through misuse. Thus tradition has it that Amir
al-mu'minin saw a group of men at his door and enquired from Qanbar who
they were and he answered they were his Shi\`ahs. On hearing this Amir
al-mu'minin had a frown on his forehead and said. "Why are they called
Shi\`ahs? They have no sign of Shi\`ahs." Thereupon Qanbar enquired what
were the signs of Shi\`ahs and Amir al-mu'minin replied: Their bellies
are thin through hunger, their lips dry through thirst and their eyes
bleared through weeping.
