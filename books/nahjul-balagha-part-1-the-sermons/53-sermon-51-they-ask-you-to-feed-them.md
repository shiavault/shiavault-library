Sermon 51: They ask you to feed them ...
========================================

*When in Siffin the men of Mu\`awiyah overpowered the men of Amir
al-mu’minin and occupied the bank of River Euphrates and prevented them
from taking its water, Amir al-mu’minin said:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلامه (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لمّا غلب أصحاب معاوية أصحابه عليه السلام على شريعة الفرات بصفين
ومنعوهم الماء
  </p>
</blockquote>

They[^1] are asking you morsels of battle. So either you remain in
ignominy and the lowest position or drench your swords with blood and
quench your thirst with water. Real death is in the life of subjugation
while real life is in dying as subjugators. Beware, Mu\`awiyah is
leading a small group of insurgents and has kept them in dark about the
true facts with the result that they have made their bosoms the targets
of death.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَدِ اسْتَطْعَمُوكُمُ الْقِتَالَ، فَأَقِرُّوا عَلَى مَذَلَّة،
وَتَأْخِيرِ مَحَلَّة، أَوْ رَوُّوا السُّيُوفَ مِنَ الدِّمَاءِ
تَرْوَوْا مِنَ الْمَاءِ، فَالمَوْتُ في حَيَاتِكُمْ مَقْهُورِينَ،
وَالْحَيَاةُ في مَوْتِكُمْ قَاهِرِينَ. أَلاَ وَإِنَّ مُعَاوِيَةَ قَادَ
لُمَةً مِنَ الْغُوَاةِ وَعَمَّسَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَرَ، حَتَّى جَعَلُوا
نُحُورَهُمْ أَغْرَاضَ الْمَنِيَّةِ.

(1) Nasr, *Siffin*, see Ibn Abi al-Hadid, Sharh, I, 329.

[^1]: Amir al-mu'minin had not reached Siffin when Mu\`awiyah posted
forty thousand men on the bank of the River to close the way to the
watering place, so that none except the Syrians could take the water.
When Amir al-mu'mimin's force alighted there they found that there was
no watering place except this one for them to take water. If there was
one it was difficult to reach there by crossing high hillocks. Amir
al-mu'minin sent Sa\`sa\`ah ibn Suhan al-\`Abdi to Mu\`awiyah with the
request to raise the control over water. Mu\`awiyah refused. On this
side Amir al-mu'minin's army was troubled by thirst. When Amir
al-mu'minin noticed this position he said, "Get up and secure water by
dint of sword." Consequently, these thirsty persons drew their swords
out of sheaths, put arrows in their bows and dispersing Mu\`awiyah's men
went right down into the River and then hit these guards away and
occupied the watering place themselves. Now, Amir al-mu'minin's men also
desired that just as Mu\`awiyah had put restriction on water by
occupation of the watering place, the same treatment should be accorded
to him and his men and no Syrian should be allowed water and everyone of
them should be made to die of thirst. But Amir al-mu'minin said, "Do you
want to take the same brutal step which these Syrians had taken? Never
prevent anyone from water. Whoever wants to drink, may drink and whoever
wants to take away may take away." Consequently, despite occupation of
the River by Amir al-mu'minin's army no one was prevented from the water
and everyone was given full liberty to take water.
