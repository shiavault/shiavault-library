I am surprised at the son of an-Nabighah that he says about me among the
people of Syria (ash-Sham) that I am a jester and that I am engaged in
frolics and fun. He said wrong and spoke sinfully. Beware, the worst
speech is what is untrue. He speaks and lies. He promises and breaks the
promise. He begs and beseeches, but when someone begs from him he
withholds miserly. He betrays the pledge and ignores kinship.

عَجَباً لاِبْنِ النَّابِغَةِ! يَزْعُمُ لاِهْلِ الشَّامِ أَنَّ فِيَّ
دُعَابَةً، وَأَنِّي امْرُؤٌ تِلْعَابَةٌ: أُعَافِسُ وَأُمَارِسُ !
لَقَدْ قَالَ بَاطِلاً، وَنَطَقَ آثِماً. أَمَا ـ وَشَرُّ الْقَوْلِ
الْكَذِبُ ـ إِنَّهُ لَيَقُولُ فَيَكْذِبُ، وَيَعِدُ فَيُخْلِفُ،
وَيُسْأَلُ فَيَبْخَلُ، وَيَسْأَلُ فَيُلْحِفُ، وَيَخُونُ الْعَهْدَ،
وَيَقْطَعُ الْاِلَّ

When in a battle, he commands and admonishes but only until the swords
do not come into action. When such a moment arrives his great trick is
to turn naked[^1] before his adversary. By Allah, surely the remembrance
of death has kept me away from fun and play while obliviousness about
the next world has prevented him from speaking truth. He has not sworn
allegiance to Mu\`awiyah without purpose; but has beforehand got him to
agree that he will have to pay its price, and gave him an award for
forsaking religion.

فَإِذَا كَانَ عِنْدَ الْحَرْبِ فَأَيُّ زَاجِر وَآمِر هُوَ مَا لَمْ
تَأْخُذِ السُّيُوفُ مَآخِذَهَا! فَإِذَا كَانَ ذلِكَ كَانَ أَكْبَرُ
مَكيدَتِهِ أَنْ يَمْنَحَ الْقَوْمَ سُبَّتَهُ. أَمَا واللهِ إِنِّي
لَـيَمْنَعُنِي مِنَ اللَّعِبِ ذِكْرُ الْموْتِ، وَإِنَّهُ لَيمَنَعُهُ
مِنْ قَوْلِ الْحَقِّ نِسْيَانُ الاْخِرَةِ، إِنَّهُ لَمْ يُبَايعْ
مُعَاوِيَةَ حَتَّى شَرَطَ لَهُ أَنْ يُؤْتِيَهُ أَتِيَّةً، وَيَرْضَخَ
لَهُ عَلَى تَرْكِ الدِّينِ رَضِيخَةً.

[^1]: Amir al-mu'minin here refers to the incident when the 'Conqueror
of Egypt' \`Amr ibn al-\`As exhibited the feat of his courage by
displaying his private parts. What happened was that when in the
battlefield of Siffin he and Amir al-mu'minin had an encounter, he
rendered himself naked in order to ward off the blow of the sword. At
this Amir al-mu'minin turned his face away and spared him his life. The
famous Arab poet al-Farazdaq said about it: There is no good in warding
off trouble by ignominy as was done one day by \`Amr ibn al-\`As by
display of his private parts. Even in this ignoble act \`Amr ibn al-\`As
had not the credit of doing it himself, but had rather followed another
one who had preceded him, because the man who first adopted this device
was Talhah ibn Abi Talhah who had saved his life in the battle of Uhud
by becoming naked before Amir al-mu'minin, and so he showed this way to
the others. Thus, besides \`Amr ibn al-\`As this trick was played by
Busr ibn Abi Artat also to save himself from the sword of Amir
al-mu'minin. When after the performance of this notable deed Busr went
to Mu\`awiyah the latter recalled \`Amr ibn al-\`As's act as precedent
in order to remove this man's shamefulness and said, "O' Busr, no
matter. There is nothing to feel shameful about it in view of \`Amr ibn
al-\`As's precedent before you."
