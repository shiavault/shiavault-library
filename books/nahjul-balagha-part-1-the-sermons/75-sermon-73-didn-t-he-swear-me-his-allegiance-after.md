Sermon 73: Didn't he swear me his allegiance after ...
======================================================

*Amir al-mu'minin said about Marwan ibn al-Hakam at Basrah. When Marwan
was taken on the day of Jamal, he asked Hasan and Husayn (p.b.u.t.) to
intercede on his behalf before Amir al-mu'minin. So they spoke to Amir
al-mu'minin about him and he released him. Then they said, "O' Amir
al-mu'minin he desires to swear you allegiance" Whereupon Amir
al-mu'minin said:*

قالوا: أُخِذَ مروان بن الحكم أَسيراً يوم الجمل، فاستشفع الحسن والحسين
(عليهما السلام) إلى أَميرالمؤمنين (عليه السلام)، فكلّماه فيه، فخلّى
سبيله، فقالا له: يبايعك يا أميرالمؤمنين؟ فقال:

Did he not swear me allegiance after the killing of \`Uthman? Now I do
not need his allegiance, because his is the hand of a Jew. If he swears
me allegiance with his hand he would violate it after a short while.
Well, he is to get power for so long as a dog licks his nose. He is the
father of four rams (who will also rule). The people will face days
through him and his sons. [^1]

أَفَلَمْ يُبَايِعْنِي بَعْدَ قَتْلِ عُثْمانَ؟ لاَ حَاجَةَ لِي في

لَغَدَرَ بِسُبَّتِهِ. أَمَا إِنَّ لَهُ إِمْرَةً كَلَعْقَةِ الْكَلْبِ
أَنْفَهُ، وَهُوَ أَبُو الاْكُبُشِ الاْرْبَعَةِ، وَسَتَلْقَى الاْمَّة

[^1]: Marwan ibn al-Hakam was the nephew (brother's son) and son-in-law
of \`Uthman. Due to thin body and tall stature he was known with the
nickname "Khayt Batil" (the thread of wrong). When \`Abd al-Malik ibn
Marwan killed \`Amr ibn Sa\`id al-Ashdaq, his brother Yahya ibn Sa\`id
said: O' sons of Khayt Batil (the thread of the wrong) you have played
deceit on \`Amr and people like you build their houses (of authority) on
deceit and treachery. Although his father al-Hakam ibn Abi al-\`As had
accepted Islam at the time of the fall of Mecca but his behaviour and
activities were very painful to the Prophet. Consequently, the Prophet
cursed him and his descendants and said, "Woe will befall my people from
the progeny of this man." At last in view of his increasing intrigues
the Prophet externed him from Medina towards the valley of Wajj (in
Ta'if) and Marwan also went with him. Prophet did not thereafter allow
them entry in Medina all his life. Abu Bakr and \`Umar did likewise, but
\`Uthman sent for both of them during his reign, and raised Marwan to
such height as though the reins of caliphate rested in his hands.
Thereafter his circumstances became so favourable that on the death of
Mu\`awiyah ibn Yazid he became the Caliph of the Muslims. But he had
just ruled only for nine months and eighteen days that death overtook
him in such a way that his wife sat with the pillow on his face and did
not get away till he breathed his last. The four sons to whom Amir
al-mu'minin has referred were the four sons of \`Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan
namely al-Walid, Sulayman, Yazid and Hisham, who ascended the Caliphate
one after the other and coloured the pages of history with their
stories. Some commentators have regarded this reference to Marwan's own
sons whose names are \`Abd al-Malik, \`Abd al-\`Aziz, Bishr and
Muhammad. Out of these \`Abd al-Malik did become Caliph of Islam but
\`Abd al-\`Aziz became governor of Egypt, Bishr of Iraq and Muhammad of
al-Jazirah.
