Those who do not commit sins and have been gifted with safety (from
sins) should take pity on sinners and other disobedient people.
Gratefulness should be mostly their indulgence and it should prevent
them from (finding faults with) others. What about the backbiter who
blames his brother and finds fault with him? Does he not remember that
Allah has concealed the sins which he committed while they were bigger
than his brother's sins pointed out by him? How can he vilify him about
his sins when he has himself committed one like it? Even if he has not
committed a similar sin he must have committed bigger ones. By Allah,
even if he did not commit big sins but committed only small sins, his
exposing the sins of people is itself a big sin.

بِبَلْوَاهُ! أَمَا ذَكَرَ مَوْضِعَ سَتْرِ اللهِ عَلَيْهِ مَنْ
ذُنُوبِهِ [مِـ ]مَّا هُوَ أَعْظَمُ مِنَ الذَّنْبِ الَّذِي عَابَهُ
بِهِ! وَكَيْفَ يَذُمُّهُ بِذَنْب قَدْ رَكِبَ مِثْلَهُ؟! فَإِنْ لَمْ
يَكُنْ رَكِبَ ذلِكَ الذَّنْبَ بَعَيْنِهِ فَقَدْ عَصَى اللهَ فِيَما
سِوَاهُ، مِمَّا هُو أَعْظَمُ مِنْهُ، وَايْمُ اللهِ لَئِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ
عَصَاهُ فِي الْكَبِيرِ، وَعَصَاهُ فِي الصَّغِيرِ، لجُرْأتُهُ عَلَى
عَيْبِ النَّاسِ أَكْبَرُ!

O creature of Allah, do not be quick in exposition anyone's sin for he
may be forgiven for it, and do not feel yourself safe even for a small
sin because you may be punished for it. Therefore, every one of you who
comes to know the faults of others should not expose them in view of
what he knows about his own faults, and he should remain busy in thanks
that he has been saved from what others have been indulging in.

يَا عَبْدَ اللهِ، لاَ تَعْجَلْ فِي عَيْبِ أَحَد بِذَنْبِهِ،
فَلَعَلَّهُ مَغْفُورٌ لَهُ، وَلاَ تَأْمَنْ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ صَغِيرَ
مَعْصِيَة، فَلَعَلَّكَ مُعَذَّبٌ عَلَيْهِ; فَلْيَكْفُفْ مَنْ عَلِمَ
مِنْكُمْ عَيْبَ غَيْرِهِ لِمَا يَعْلَمُ مِنْ عَيْبِ نَفْسِهِ،
وَلْيَكُنِ الشُّكْرُ شَاغِلاً لَهُ عَلَى مُعَافَاتِهِ مِمَّا ابْتُلِيَ
بِهِ غَيْرُهُ.

[^1]: The habit of fault finding and backbiting has become so common
that even the feeling of its evilness has disappeared. And at present
neither the high avoid it nor the low; neither the high position of the
pulpit prevents it nor the sacredness of the mosque. Whenever a few
companions sit together their topic of conversation and engaging
interest is just to discuss the faults of their opponents with added
colourisation, and to listen to them attentively. Although the fault
finder is himself involved in the faults which he picks up in others,
yet he does not like that his own faults should be exposed. In such a
case, he should have consideration for similar feelings in others and
should avoid searching for their faults and hurting their feelings. He
should act after the proverb: "Do not do unto others what you do not
want others to do unto you." Backbiting is defined as the exposure of
the fault of a brother-in-faith with the intent to vilify him in such a
way as to irritate him, whether it be by speaking, acting, implication
or suggestion. Some people take backbiting to cover only that which is
false or contrary to fact. According to them to relate what was seen or
heard, exactly as it was, is not backbiting, and they say that they are
not backbiting but only relating exactly what they saw or heard. But in
fact backbiting is the name of this very relating of the facts, because
if it is not factually correct it would be false accusation and wrong
blame. It is related about the Prophet that he said: "Do you know what
backbiting is?" People said, "Allah and His Prophet know better." Then
he said, "Backbiting means that you say about your brother a thing which
pains him." Someone said, "But what if I say what is actually true about
him?" The Prophet replied, "It is backbiting only when it is factually
true, otherwise you would be accusing him falsely." There are many
causes for indulging in backbiting, and because of this a man commits it
sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly. Abu Hamid al-Ghazali has
recounted these causes in detail in his book Ihya' \`ulumu'd-din. A few
of the important ones are: 1) To make fun of anyone or to make him
appear abased. 2) To make people laugh and to display one's own
jolliness and high spiritedness. 3) Expressing one's feelings under the
influence of rage and anger. 4) To establish one's feelings under the
influence of rage and anger. 5) To disprove one's connection or
involvement in a matter; namely that a particular evil was not committed
by oneself but by someone else. 6) To associate oneself with some group
when in their company in order to avoid strangeness with them. 7) To
belittle a person from whom it is feared that he will expose some fault
of one's. 8) To defeat a competitor in the same calling. 9) To seek
position in the audience of someone in power. 10) To express sorrow by
saying it is sad that so-and-so has fallen in such and such a sin. 11)
To express astonishment, for example, to say it is wonderful that so and
so has done this. 12) To name the committer of an act when expressing
anger over it. However, in some cases fault finding or criticising does
not fall under backbiting. 1) If the oppressed complains of the
oppressor in order to seek redress, it is not backbiting. Allah says
about it: Loveth not Allah open utterance of evil in speech except by
one who hath been wronged.. (Qur'an, 4:148) 2) To relate anyone's fault
while giving advice is no backbiting because dishonesty and duplicity is
not permissible in counselling. 3) If in connection with seeking the
requirements of a religious commandment the naming of a particular
individual cannot be avoided, then to state the fault of such person to
the extent necessary would not be backbiting. 4) To relate the
misappropriation or dishonesty committed by someone with a view to
saving a Muslim brother from harm would not be backbiting. 5) To relate
the fault of someone before one who can prevent him from committing it
is not backbiting. 6) Criticism and expression of opinion about a
relater of traditions is not backbiting. 7) If a person is well
acquainted with someone's shortcoming, then to relate such a fault in
order to define his personality, for example, describing a deaf, dumb,
lame or handless person as thus, is not backbiting. 8) To describe any
fault of a patient before a physician for purposes of treatment is not
backbiting. 9) If someone claims wrong lineage then to expose his
correct lineage is not backbiting. 10) If the life, property or honour
of someone can be protected only by informing him of some fault, it
would not be backbiting. 11) If two persons discuss a fault of another
which is already known to both it would not be backbiting, although to
avoid discussing it is better, since it is possible one of the two might
have forgotten it. 12) To expose the evils of one who openly commits
evils is not back-biting as the tradition runs: "There is no backbiting
in the case of he who has torn away the veil of shamefulness."
