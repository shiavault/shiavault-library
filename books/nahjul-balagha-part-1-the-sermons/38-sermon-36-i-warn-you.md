I am warning you that you will be killed on the bend of this canal and
on the level of this low area while you will have no clear excuse before
Allah nor any open authority with you. You have come out of your houses
and then divine decree entangled you.

I had advised you against this arbitration but you rejected my advice
like adversaries and opponents till I turned my ideas in the direction
of your wishes. You are a group whose heads are devoid of wit and
intelligence. May you have no father! (Allah’s woe be to you!) I have
not put you in any calamity nor wished you harm.

فَأَنَا نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ أَنْ تُصْبِحُوا صَرْعَى بِأَثْنَاءِ هذَا
النَّهَرِ، وَبِأَهْضَامِ هذَاالْغَائِطِ عَلَى غَيْرِ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ
رَبِّكُمْ، وَلاَ سُلْطَانٍ مُبِينٍ مَعَكُمْ، قَدْ طَوَّحَتْ بِكُمُ
الدَّارُ، وَاحْتَبَلَكُمُ الْمِقْدَارُ وَقَدْ كُنْتُ نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنْ
هذِهِ الْحُكُومَةِ فَأَبَيْتُمْ عَلَيَّ إِبَاءَ المخالفين، حَتَّى
صَرَفْتُ رَأْيِي إِلَىْ هَوَاكُمْ، وَأَنْتُمْ مَعَاشِرُ أَخِفَّاءُ
الْهَامِّ، سُفَهَاءُ الاْحْلاَمِ وَلَمْ آتِ ـ لاَ أَبَا لَكُمْ ـ
بُجْراً وَلاَ أَرَدْتُ لَكُمْ ضُرّاً.

[^1]: The cause of the battle of Nahrawan was that when after
Arbitration Amir al-mu'minin was returning to Kufah, the people who were
foremost in pleading acceptance of Arbitration began to say that
appointment of anyone other than Allah as arbitrator is heresy, and
that, Allah forbid, by accepting the Arbitration Amir al-mu'minin turned
heretic. Consequently, by distorting the meaning of "There is no
authority same with Allah" they made simple Muslims share their views
and separating from Amir al-mu'minin encamped at Hanira' near Kufah.
When Amir al-mu'minin learned of these plottings he sent Sa\`sa\`ah ibn
Suhan al-\`Abdi and Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi in the company of Ibn
\`Abbas towards them and afterwards himself went to the place of their
stay and dispersed them after discussion. When these people reached
Kufah they began to spread the news that Amir al-mu'minin had broken the
agreement of Arbitration and that he is again ready to fight against the
Syrians. When Amir al-mu'minin learned this he contradicted it whereupon
these people stood up in rebellion and encamped twelve miles from
Baghdad in the low area of the canal called Nahrawan. On the other side,
after hearing the verdict of Arbitration Amir al-mu'minin rose for
fighting the army of Syria and wrote to the Kharijites that the verdict
passed by the two arbitrators in pursuance of their heart's wishes
instead of the Qur'an and sunnah was not acceptable to him, that he had
therefore decided to fight with them and they should support him for
crushing the enemy. But the Kharijites gave him this reply, "When you
had agreed to Arbitration in our view you had turned heretic. Now if you
admit your heresy and offer repentance we will think over this matter
and decide what we should do." Amir al-mu'minin understood from their
reply that their disobedience and misguidance had become very serious.
To entertain any kind of hope from them now was futile. Consequently,
ignoring them he encamped in the valley of an-Nukhaylah with a view to
marching towards Syria. When the army had been arrayed he came to know
that the men desired to deal with the people of Nahrawan first, and to
move towards Syria afterwards. Amir al-mu'minin, however, said that they
should be left as they were, that they themselves should first move
towards Syria while the people of Nahrawan could be dealt with
afterwards. People said that they were prepared to obey every order of
his with all their might whether he moved this way or that way. The army
had not moved when news about the rebellion of Kharijites began to
reach, and it was learnt that they had butchered the governor of
Nahrawan namely \`Abdullah ibn Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and his slave maid
with the child in her womb, and have killed three women of Banu Tayyi
and Umm Sinan as-Saydawiyyah. Amir al-mu'minin sent al-Harith ibn Murrah
al-\`Abdi for investigation but he too was killed by them. When their
rebellion reached this stage it was necessary to deal with them.
Consequently, the army turned towards Nahrawan. On reaching there Amir
al-mu'minin sent them word that those who had killed \`Abdullah ibn
Khabbab ibn al-Aratt and innocent women should be handed over to him for
avenging blood. Those people replied that they had killed these persons
jointly and that they considered it lawful to shed the blood of all the
people on his side. Even at this Amir al-mu'minin did not take the
initiative for the battle, but sent Abu Ayyub al-Ansari with a message
of peace. So he spoke to them aloud, "Whoever comes under this banner or
separates from that party and goes to Kufah or al-Mada'in would get
amnesty and he would not be questioned. As a result of this Farwah ibn
Nawfal al-Ashja'i said that he did not know why they were at war with
Amir al-mu'minin. Saying this he separated along with five hundred men.
Similarly group after group began to separate and some of them joined
Amir al-mu'minin. Those who remained numbered four thousand, and
according to at-Tabari's account they numbered two thousand eight
hundred. These people were not in any way prepared to listen to the
voice of truth, and were ready to kill or be killed. Amir al-mu'minin
had stopped his men to take the initiative but the Kharijites put arrows
in their bows and broke and threw away the sheathes of their swords.
Even at this juncture Amir al-mu'minin warned them of the dire
consequences of war and this sermon is about that warning and
admonition. But they were so brimming with enthusiasm that they leapt on
Amir al-mu'minin's force all of a sudden. This onslaught was so severe
that the foot men lost ground but they soon fixed themselves firmly that
the attack of arrows and spears could not dislodge them from their
position and they soon so cleared away the Kharijites that except for
nine persons who fled away to save their lives not a single person was
left alive. From Amir al-mu'minin's army only eight persons fell as
martyrs. The battle took place on the 9th Safar, 38 A.H.
