Sermon 201: O people! Do not be desolate at the small number….
==============================================================

*One should not be afraid of the scarcity of those who tread on the
right path (a counsel to tread the clear path of guidance)*

O people! Do not be desolate at the small number of those who follow the
right path, because people throng only round the table (of this world)
where the duration of satiety is short and its hunger is prolonged.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، لاَ تَسْتَوْحِشُوا فِي طَرِيقِ الْهُدَىُ لِقِلَّةِ
أَهْلِهِ، فَإِنَّ النَّاسَ قَدِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى مَائِدَة شِبَعُهَا
قَصِيرٌ، وَجُوعُهَا طَوِيلٌ.

O people, certainly, what gathers people together (in categories) is
(their) agreement (to good or bad) and (their) disagreement, for only
one individual killed the camel of Thamud [^1] but Allah held all of
them in punishment because all of them consented to it. Thus, Allah, the
Glorified. has said:

***Then they hamstrung her, and turned*** **(themselves)**
***regretful.*** **(Qur'an, 26:157).**

Then their land declined by sinking (into the earth) as the spike of a
plough pierces unploughed weak land. O people, he who treads the clear
path (of guidance) reaches the spring of water, and whoever abandons it
strays into waterless desert.

أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إِنَّمَا يَجْمَعُ النَّاسَ الرِّضِى وَالسُّخْطُ،
وَإِنَّمَا عَقَرَ نَاقَةَ ثَمُودَ رَجُلٌ وَاحِدٌ فَعَمَّهُمُ اللهُ
تَعَالَى بالْعَذَابِ لَمَّا عَمُّوهُ بالرِّضَى، فَقَالَ سُبْحَانَهُ:
(فَعَقَرُوهَا فَأَصْبَحُوا نَادِمِينَ)، فَمَا كَانَ إِلاَّ أَنْ
خَارَتْ أَرْضُهُمْ بِالْخَسْفَةِ خُوَارَالسِّكَّةِ الْـمُحْمَاةِ فِي
الاْرْضِ الْخَوَّارَةِ. أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، مَنْ سَلَكَ الطّرِيقَ
الْوَاضِحَ وَرَدَ الْمَاءَ، وَمَنْ خَالَفَ وَقَعَ فِي التِيهِ!

[^1]: Thamud, in ancient Arabia, a tribe or group of tribes, seems to
have been prominent from about the 4th Century B.C. to the first half of
the 7th Century A.D. Their place of stay and homeland was at a place
lying on the way between the Hijaz and Syria called the Valley of
al-Qura and bore this name because it consisted of several townships.
Allah deputed for their guidance and directions the Prophet Salih who
preached to them as Allah relates in his story: And unto (the people of)
Thamud (We did send) their brother Salih, he said: "O' my people!
Worship ye Allah (alone). Ye have no god other than Him; indeed came
unto you a clear proof from your Lord; this is the She-camel of Allah
(which) unto you is a sign, so leave it (free) to pasture in Allah's
earth and touch her not with any harm, or ye shall be seized with a
painful chastisement. And remember when He made you successors after the
(people) \`Ad and settled you in the earth, ye build mansions on its
plain and hew the mountains into dwellings. So remember ye the bounties
of Allah, and see ye not evil in the earth, making mischief." Said the
chiefs of those who were puffed up with pride among his people to those
who were reckoned weak, to those who believed from among them; "Know ye
that Salih is sent by his Lord?" Said they: "Verily, in what he hath
been sent with, we are believers." Said those who were puffed up with
pride; "Verily we, in that which ye believe are disbelievers." They
hamstrung the She-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord,
and they said: "O' Salih! bring us what thou didst, threaten us with, if
thou art of the apostles." Then seized them (unawares) the earthquake,
so became they in their dwellings, motionless (dead). Then he turned
away from them and said: "O' my people! Indeed I did deliver unto you
the message of my Lord, and did admonish you, but ye love not the
admonishers." (Qur'an, 7:73-79). (The people of) Thamud belied the
warners, and said they: "What! a single man, from among us! and we to
follow him? Verily then we shall be astray and in distress. It is that
(the duty of) reminding hath been bestowed on him (alone), of all the
(people) among us? Nay! he is a great liar, an insolent one!" "Soon they
shall know on the morrow, (as to) who is the liar, the insolent one! (O'
Our Apostle Salih!) verily We are going to send the She-camel as a trial
for them; so watch them and be patient. And (thou O' Salih!) make them
aware (beforehand) that the water is (to be) divided between them; and
every drinking share shall be witnessed (on it)." But they called their
companions, then he pursued (her) and hamstrung (her). How (great) was
My chastisement and My warning? Verily sent We upon them a single
(violent) blast, and they were (all) like the dry stubble used by a
fencer in a fence. (Qur'an, 54:23-31).
