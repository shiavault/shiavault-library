======================================================

*Amir al-mu'minin said to his companions about Mu\`awiyah*

Soon after me, there would be put on you a man with a broad mouth and a
big belly. He would swallow whatever he gets and would crave for what he
does not get. You should kill him but (I know) you would not kill him.
He would command you to abuse me and to renounce me. As for abusing, you
do abuse me because that would mean purification for me and salvation
for you. As regards renunciation, you should not renounce me because I
have been born on the natural religion (Islam) and was foremost in
accepting it as well as in Hijrah ( migrating from Mecca to Medina).[^1]

أما إنِّهُ سِيَظْهَرُ عَلَيْكُمْ بَعْدِي رَجُلٌ رَحْبُ الْبُلْعُومِ،
مُنْدَحِقُ الْبَطْنِ، يَأْكُلُ مَا يَجِدُ، وَيَطْلُبُ مَا لاَ يَجِدُ،
فَاقْتُلُوهُ، وَلَنْ تَقْتُلُوهُ! أَلاَ وَإِنَّهُ سَيَأْمُرُكُمْ
بِسَبِّي وَالْبَرَاءَةِ مِنِّي; فَأَمَّا السَّبُّ فَسُبُّونِي،
فَإِنَّهُ لي زَكَاةٌ،وَلَكُمْ نَجَاةٌ; وَأَمَّا الْبَرَاءَةُ فَلاَ
تَتَبَرَّأُوا مِنِّي، فَإِنِّي وَلِدْتُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ، وَسَبَقْتُ
إِلَى الاْيمَانِ وَالْهِجْرَةِ.

[^1]: About the person to whom Amir al-mu'minin has alluded in this
sermon some people hold that he is Ziyad ibn Abih; some hold that he is
al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi and some hold that he is Mughirah ibn
Shu\`bah. But most of the commentators have held him to be Mu\`awiyah
and this is correct because the qualities that Amir al-mu'minin has
described prove true fully on him alone .Thus Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has
written about the gluttonous quality of Mu\`awiyah that once the prophet
sent for him and he was informed that Mu\`awiyah was busy eating. Then a
second and third time a man was sent to call him but he brought the same
news. Thereupon the Prophet said , "May Allah never satisfy his belly."
The effect of this curse was that when he felt tired of eating he would
say , "Take away, for, by Allah I am not satiated but I am tired and
disgusted." Similarly, his abusing Amir al-mu'minin and ordering his
officers for it are such accepted facts of history about which there is
no scope of denying. In this connection such words were used on the
pulpit that even Allah and the Prophet were hit by them. Thus, Umm
al-mu'minin Umm Salamah wrote to Mu\`awiyah, "Certainly you people abuse
Allah and the Prophet, and this is like this that you hurl abuses on
\`Ali and those who love him, while I do stand witness that Allah and
the Prophet did love him." (al-\`Iqd al-Farid, Vol. 3, p. 131) Thanks to
\`Umar ibn \`Abdil-\`Aziz who put a stop to it, and introduced the
following verse in place of abuse in the sermons: Verily Allah enjoineth
justice and benevolence (to others) and giving unto the kindred, and
forbidden lewdness, and evil, and rebellion; He exhorteth you that ye
may take heed (Qur'an 16:90) In this sermon Amir al-mu'minin has ordered
his killing on the basis of the Prophet's order that "When you (O'
Muslims) see Mu\`awiyah on my pulpit, kill him." (Kitab Siffin, pp. 243,
248; Sharh of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, Vol. 1, p.348; Ta'rikh Baghdad, Vol. 12,
p. 181; Mizan al-I\`tidal, Vol. 2, p. 128; Tahdhib at-tahdhib, Vol. 2,
p. 428; Vol. 5, p. 110; Vol. 7, p. 324)
