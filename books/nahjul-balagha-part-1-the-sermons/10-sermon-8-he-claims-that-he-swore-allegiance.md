He claims that he swore allegiance to me with his hand but did not swear
with his heart.[^1] So he does admit allegiance. As regards his claiming
it otherwise than with his heart he should come forward with a clear
argument for it. Otherwise, he should return to wherefrom he has gone
out.[^2]

يَزْعُمُ أَنَّهُ قَدْ بَايَعَ بِيَدِهِ، وَلَمْ يُبَايعْ بِقَلْبِهِ،
فَقَدْ أَقَرَّ بِالبَيْعَةِ، وَادَّعَى الوَلِيجَةَ، فَلْيَأْتِ
عَلَيْهَا بِأَمْر يُعْرَفُ، وَإِلاَّ فَلْيَدخُلْ فِيَما خَرَجَ مِنْهُ.

(2) al-Waqidi, *al-Jamal.*

[^1]: When after swearing allegiance on the hand of Amir al-mu'minin,
az-Zubayr ibn al-\`Awwam broke the allegiance, then sometimes he put
forth the excuse that he was forced to swear allegiance and that forced
allegiance is no allegiance, and sometimes he said that allegiance was
only for show. His heart did not go in accord with it. As though he
himself admitted with his tongue the duplicity of his outer appearance
and inner self. But this excuse is like that of the one who reverts to
apostasy after adopting Islam and to avoid penalty may say that he had
accepted Islam only by the tongue, not in the heart. Obviously, such an
excuse cannot be heard, nor can avoid punishment by this argument. If
az-Zubayr suspected that \`Uthman was slain at Amir al-mu'minin's
insistence, this suspicion should have existed when he was taking oath
for obedience and stretching his hand for allegiance, not now that his
expectations were getting frustrated and hopes had started dawning from
somewhere else.

[^2]: Amir al-mu'minin has rejected his claim in short form thus: that
when he admits that his hands had paid allegiance then until there is
justification for breaking of the allegiance he should stick to it. But
if, according to him his heart was not in accord with it he should
produce other proof for it. Since proof about the state of heart cannot
be adduced how can he bring such proof, and an assertion without proof
is unacceptable to his mind.
