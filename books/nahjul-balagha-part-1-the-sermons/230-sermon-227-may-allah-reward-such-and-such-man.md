May Allah reward such and such man [^1] who straightened the curve,
cured the disease, abandoned mischief and established the *sunnah*. He
departed (from this world) with untarnished clothes and little
shortcomings. He achieved good (of this world) and remained safe from
its evils. He offered Allah's obedience and feared Him as He deserved.
He went away and left the people in dividing ways wherein the misled
cannot obtain guidance and the guided cannot attain certainty.

Maytham al-Bahrani, IV, 97.

[^1]: Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written (in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 14,
pp. 3-4) that the reference here is to the second Caliph \`Umar, and
that these sentences have been uttered in his praise as indicated by the
word '\`Umar' written under the word 'such and such' in as-Sayyid
ar-Radi's own hand in the manuscript of Nahjul Balaghah written by him.
This is Ibn Abi'l-Hadid's statement, but it is to be seen that if
as-Sayyid ar-Radi had written the word '\`Umar' by way of explanation it
should have existed, as other explanations by him have remained, in
those versions which have been copied from his manuscript. Even now
there exists in al-Musil (Iraq) university the oldest copy of Nahjul
Balaghah written by the famous calligraphist Yaqut al-Musta\`simi; but
no one has afforded any clue to this explanation of as-Sayyid ar-Radi.
Even if the view of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid is accepted it would be deemed to
represent the personal opinion of as-Sayyid ar-Radi which may serve as a
supplementary argument in support of an original argument but this
personal view cannot be assigned any regular importance. It is strange
that two and a half centuries after as-Sayyid ar-Radi namely in the
seventh century A.H., Ibn Abi'l Hadid makes the statement that the
reference here is to Caliph \`Umar and that as-Sayyid ar-Radi himself
had so indicated, as a result of which some other annotators also
followed the same line, but the contemporaries of as-Sayyid ar-Radi who
wrote about Nahjul Balaghah have given no such indication in their
writings although as contemporaries they should have had better
information about as-Sayyid Ar-Radi's writing. Thus, al-\`Allamah \`Ali
ibn Nasir who was a contemporary of as-Sayyid ar-Radi and wrote an
annotation of Nahjul Balaghah under the name of A\`lam Nahjul Balaghah
writes in connection with this sermon: Amir al-mu'minin has praised one
of his own companions for his good conduct. He had died before the
troubles that arose after the death of the Prophet of Allah. This is
supported by the annotations of Nahjul Balaghah written by al-\`Allamah
Qutbu'd-Din ar-Rawandi (d. 573 A.H.). Ibn Abi'l-Hadid (vol. 14, p. 4)
and Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani (in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 4, p. 97)
have quoted his following view. By this Amir al-mu'minin refers to one
of his own companions who died before the mischief and disruption that
occurred following the death of the Prophet of Allah. Al-\`Allamah
al-Hajj al-Mirza Habibu'llah al-Khu'i is of the opinion that the person
is Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar on the ground that after the
assassination of Malik the situation of the Muslim community was such as
Amir al-mu'minin explains in this sermon. al-Khu'i adds that: Amir
al-mu'minin has praised Malik repeatedly such as in his letter to the
people of Egypt sent through Malik when he was made the governor of that
place, and like his utterances when the news of Malik's assassination
reached him, he said: "Malik! who is Malik? If Malik was a stone, he was
hard and solid; if he was a rock, he was a great rock which had no
parallel. Women have become barren to give birth to such as Malik." Amir
al-mu'minin had even expressed in some of his utterances that, "Malik
was to me as I was to the Holy Prophet." Therefore, one who possesses
such a position certainly deserves such attributes and even beyond that.
(Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 14, pp. 374-375) If these words had been
about Caliph \`Umar and there was some trustworthiness about it Ibn
Abi'l-Hadid would have recorded the authority or tradition and it would
have existed in history and been known among the people. But here
nothing is found to prove the statement except a few self-concocted
events. Thus about the pronouns in the words "khayraha" and "sharraha"
he takes them to refer to the caliphate and writes that these words can
apply only to one who enjoys power and authority because without
authority it is impossible to establish the sunnah or prevent
innovation. This is the gist of the argument he has advanced on this
occasion; although there is no proof to establish that the antecedent of
this pronoun is the caliphate. It can rather refer to the world (when
Amir al-mu'minin says, "He achieved good [of this world] and remained
safe from its evils.") and that would be in accord with the context.
Again, to regard authority as a condition for the safeguarding of
people's interest and the propagation of the sunnah means to close the
door to prompting others to good and dissuading them from evil, although
Allah has assigned this duty to a group of the people without the
condition of authority: And that there should be among you a group who
call (mankind) unto virtue and enjoin what is good and forbid wrong; and
these are they who shall be successful. (Qur'an, 3:104) Similarly it is
related from the Prophet: So long as people go on prompting for good and
dissuading from evil and assisting each other in virtue and piety they
will remain in righteousness. Again, Amir al-mu'minin, in the course of
a will, says in general terms: Establish the pillars of the Unity of
Allah and the sunnah, and keep both these lamps aflame. In these sayings
there is no hint that this obligation cannot be discharged without
authority. Facts also tell us that (despite army and force, and power
and authority) the rulers and kings could not prevent evil or propagate
virtue to the extent to which some unknown godly persons were able to
inculcate moral values by imprinting their morality on heart and minds,
although they were not backed by any army or force and they didn't have
any equipment save destitution. No doubt authority and control can bend
heads down before it, but it is not necessary that it should also pave
the way for virtue in hearts. History shows that most of the rulers
destroyed the features of Islam. Islam's existence and progress has been
possible by the efforts of those helpless persons who possessed nothing
save poverty and discomfiture. If it is insisted that the reference here
should only be to a ruler, then why should it not be taken to mean a
companion of Amir al-mu'minin who had been the head of a Province such
as Salman al-Farisi for whose burial Amir al-mu'minin went to
al-Mada'in; and it is not implausible that Amir al-mu'minin might have
uttered these words after his burial by way of comments on his life and
way of governance. However, to believe that they are about Caliph \`Umar
is without any proof. In the end, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has quoted the
following statements of (the historian) at-Tabari in proof of his
hypothesis: "It is related from al-Mughirah ibn Shu\`bah that when
Caliph \`Umar died Ibnah Abi Hathmah said crying. "Oh \`Umar, you were
the man who straightened the curve, removed ills, destroyed mischief,
revived the sunnah, remained chaste and departed without entangling in
evils.' (According to at-Tabari) al-Mughirah related that "When \`Umar
was buried I came to \`Ali and I wanted to hear something from him about
\`Umar. So, on my arrival Amir al-mu'minin came out in this state that
was wrapped in one cloth after bathing and was jerking the hair of his
head and beard and he had no doubt that the Caliphate would come to him.
On this occasion he said, "May Allah have mercy on \`Umar." Ibnah Abi
Hathmah has correctly said that he enjoyed the good of the Caliphate and
remained safe from its evils. By Allah, she did not say it herself but
was made to say so." (at-Tabari, vol. 1, p. 2763; Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol.
12, p. 5; Ibn Kathir, vol. 7, p. 140) The relater of this event is
al-Mughirah ibn Shu\`bah whose adultery with Umm Jamil, the Caliph
\`Umar's saving him from the penalty despite the evidence, and his
openly abusing Amir al-mu'minin in Kufah under Mu\`awiyah's behest are
admitted facts of history. On this ground what weight his statements can
carry is quite clear. From the factual point of view also, this story
cannot be accepted. Al-Mughirah's statement that Amir al-mu'minin had no
doubt about his Caliphate is against the facts. What were the factors
from which he made this guess when the actual facts were to the
contrary. If the caliphate was certain for any one, it was \`Uthman.
Thus, at the Consultative Committee \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf said to
Amir al-mu'minin: "O' \`Ali! do not create a situation against yourself
for I have observed and consulted the people and they all want
\`Uthman." (at-Tabari, vol. 1, p. 2786; Ibn al-Athir, vol. 3, p. 71;
Abu'l-Fida', vol. 1, p. 166) Consequently, Amir al-mu'minin was sure not
to get the caliphate as has already been stated on the authority of
at-Tabari's History, under the sermon of the Camel's Foam
(ash-Shiqshiqiyyah), namely that on seeing the names of the members of
the Consultative Committee, Amir al-mu'minin had said to al-\`Abbas ibn
\`Abd al-Muttalib that the caliphate could not be given to anyone except
\`Uthman since all the powers had been given to \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn
\`Awf and he was \`Uthman's brother-in-law (sister's husband) and Sa\`d
ibn Abi Waqqas was a relative and tribesman of \`Abd ar-Rahman. These
two would join in giving the caliphate to him. At this stage, the
question arises as to what the reason was that actuated al-Mughirah to
prompt Amir al-mu'minin to say something about \`Umar. If he knew that
Amir al-mu'minin had good ideas about \`Umar, he should have also known
his impression; but if he thought that Amir al-mu'minin did not
entertain good ideas about him then the purpose of his asking Amir
al-mu'minin would be none other than that whatever he may say he would,
by exposing it, create an atmosphere against him and make the members of
the Consultative Committee suspicious of him. The views of the members
of the Consultative Committee are well understood from the very fact
that by putting the condition of following the conduct of the first two
Caliphs in electing the caliph they had shown their adherence to them.
In these circumstances when al-Mughirah tried to play this trick Amir
al-mu'minin said just by way of relating a fact that \`Umar achieved the
good (of this world) and remained safe from its evil. This sentence has
no connection with praise or eulogy. \`Umar did in his days enjoy all
kinds of advantages while his period was free from the mischiefs that
cropped up later. After recording this statement Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes:
From this event the belief gains strength that in this utterance the
allusion is towards \`Umar. If the utterance means the word uttered by
Ibnah Abi Hathmah about which Amir al-mu'minin has said that they are
not her own heart's voice but she was made to utter them, then
doubtlessly the reference is to \`Umar, but the view that these words
were uttered by Amir al-mu'minin in praise of \`Umar is not at all
established. Rather, from this tradition it is evidently shown that
these words were uttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah. Allah alone knows on what
ground the words of Ibnah Abi Hathmah are quoted and then it is daringly
argued that these words were uttered by Amir al-mu'minin about \`Umar.
It seems Amir al-mu'minin had uttered these words about someone on some
occasion, then Ibnah Abi Hathmah used similar words on \`Umar's death
and then even Amir al-mu'minin's words were taken to be in praise of
\`Umar. Otherwise, no mind except a mad one can argue that the words
uttered by Ibnah Abi Hathmah should be deemed a ground to hold that Amir
al-mu'minin said these words in praise of \`Umar. Can it be expected,
after (a glance at) the sermon of the Camel's Foam, that Amir
al-mu'minin might have uttered these words. Again, it is worth
consideration that if these words had been uttered by Amir al-mu'minin
on \`Umar's death, then at the Consultative Committee when he refused to
follow the conduct of the (first) two Caliphs it should have been said
to him that only the other day he has said that \`Umar had established
the sunnah and banished innovations, so that when his conduct was in
accord with the sunnah what was the sense in accepting the sunnah but
refusing to follow his conduct.
