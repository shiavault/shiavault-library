Praise be to Allah from whose view one sky does not conceal another sky
nor one earth another earth.

Someone [^1] said to me, "O' son of Abi Talib, you are eager for the
caliphate." Then I told him:

"Rather, you are, by Allah, more greedy, although more remote, while I
am more suited as well as nearer. I have demanded it as my right, while
you are intervening between me and it, and you are turning my face from
it." When I knocked at his ears with arguments among the crowd of those
present he was startled as if he was stunned not knowing what reply to
give me about it.

Seeking aid against the Quraysh

O My God! I seek Thy succour against the Quraysh and those who are
assisting them, because they are denying me (the rights of) kinship,
have lowered my high position, and are united in opposing me in the
matter (of the caliphate) which is my right, and then they said, "Know
that the rightful thing is that you have it and also that you may leave
it." [^2]

وَأَجْمَعُوا عَلَى مُنَازَعَتِي أَمْراً هُوَ لِي. ثُمَّ قَالُوا: أَلاَ
إنَّ فِي الْحَقِّ أَنْ تَأْخُذَهُ، وَفِي الْحَقِّ أَنْ تَتْرُكَهُ.

They (Talhah, az-Zubayr and their supporters) came out dragging the wife
of the Messenger of Allah (the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him
and his descendants) just as a maidslave is dragged for sale. They took
her to Basrah where those two (Talhah and az-Zubayr) put their own women
in their houses but exposed the wife of the Messenger of Allah to
themselves and to others in the army in which there was not a single
individual who had not offered me his obedience and sworn to me
allegiance quite obediently, without any compulsion.

Here in Basrah they approached my governor and treasurers of the public
treasury and its other inhabitants. They killed some of them in
captivity and others by treachery. By Allah, even if they had wilfully
killed only one individual from among the Muslims without any fault, it
would have been lawful for me to kill the whole of this army because
they were present in it but did not disagree with it nor prevented it by
tongue or hand, not to say that they killed from among the Muslims a
number equal to that with which they had marched on them.

[^1]: On the occasion of the Consultative Committee Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas
repeated to Amir al-mu'minin what Caliph \`Umar had said in his last
hours namely that "O' \`Ali, you are very greedy for the position of
caliphate," and \`Ali replied that, "He who demands his own right cannot
be called greedy; rather greedy is he who prevents the securing of the
right and tries to grab it despite being unfit for it." There is no
doubt that Amir al-mu'minin considered the Caliphate to be his right,
and demanded his right. The demand for a right does not dispel a right
so that it may be put forth as an excuse for not assigning him the
caliphate, and the demand may be held as a mark of greed. Even if it was
greed, who was not involved in this greed? Was not the pull between the
muhajirun and the ansar the mutual struggle between the members of the
Consultative Committee and the mischief mongering of Talhah and
az-Zubayr the product of this very greed. If Amir al-mu'minin had been
greedy for this position, he would have stood for it, closing his eyes
to the consequences and results, when \`Abbas (uncle of the Prophet) and
Abu Sufyan pressed him for (accepting) allegiance, and when, after the
third Caliph people thronged to him for (swearing) allegiance, he should
have accepted their offer without paying any attention to the
deteriorated conditions. But at no time did Amir al-mu'minin take any
step which could prove that he wanted the Caliphate for the sake of
caliphate, but rather his demand for the caliphate was only with the
object that its features should not be altered and the religion should
not become the victim of others' desires, not that he should enjoy the
pleasures of life which could be attributed to greed.

[^2]: Explaining the meaning, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes that Amir
al-mu'minin's intention was to say: They (the Quraysh and those who are
assisting them) were not only content to keep me away from my right over
the caliphate which they have usurped (from me), but rather claimed that
it was their right whether to give it to me or prevent me from the same;
and that I have no right to argue with them. Furthermore, the intention
(of Amir al-mu'minin) is that: If they had not said that it is right to
keep away from the caliphate, it would have been easy to endure it
because this would have, at least, showed their admitting my right
although they were not prepared to concede it. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah,
vol. 9, p. 306)
