You were the army of a woman and in the command of a quadruped. When it
grumbled you responded, and when it was wounded (hamstrung) you fled
away. Your character is low and your pledge is broken. Your faith is
hypocrisy. Your water is brackish. He who stays with you is laden with
sins and he who forsakes you secures Allah’s mercy. It is as though I
see your mosque prominent, resembling the surface of a boat, while Allah
has sent chastisement from above and from below it and everyone who is
on it is drowned.[^2]

By Allah, your city would certainly be drowned so much so that as though
I see its mosque like the upper part of a boat or a sitting ostrich.

Your city is the most stinking of all the cities as regards its clay,
the nearest to water and remotest from the sky. It contains nine tenths
of evil. He who enters it is surrounded with his sins and he who is out
of it enjoys Allah’s forgiveness. It seems as though I look at this
habitation of yours that water has so engulfed it that nothing can be
seen of it except the highest part of mosque appearing like the bosom of
a bird in deep sea.

[^1]: Ibn Maytham writes that when the Battle of Jamal ended then on the
third day after it Amir al-mu'minin said the morning prayer in the
central mosque of Basrah and after finishing it stood on the right side
of the prayer place reclining against the wall and delivered this sermon
wherein he described the lowness of character of the people of Basrah
and their slyness, namely that they got enflamed at others' instigation
without anything of their own and making over their command to a woman
clung to a camel. They broke away after swearing allegiance and
exhibited their low character and evil nature by practising double
facedness. In this sermon woman implies \`A'ishah and quadruped implies
the camel (Jamal) after which this battle has been named the Battle of
Jamal.' This battle originated in this way that when although during the
life time of \`Uthman, \`A'ishah used to oppose him and had left for
Mecca leaving him in siege and as such she had a share in his
assassination details of which would be stated at some suitable place
but when on her return from Mecca towards Medina she heard from
\`Abdullah ibn Salamah that after \`Uthman allegiance had been paid to
\`Ali (as Caliph) she suddenly exclaimed, "If allegiance has been paid
to \`Ali, I wish the sky had burst on the earth. Let me go back to
Mecca." Consequently she decided to return to Mecca and began saying,
"By Allah \`Uthman has been killed helplessly. I shall certainly avenge
his blood." On seeing this wide change in the state of affairs Abu
Salamah said, "What are you saying as you yourself used to say "Kill
this Na\`thal ; he had turned unbeliever." Thereupon she replied, "Not
only I but everyone used to say so; but leave these things and listen to
what I am now saying, that is better and deserves more attention. It is
so strange that first he was called upon to repent but before giving him
an opportunity to do so he has been killed." On this Abu Salamah recited
the following verses addressing her: You started it and now you are
changing and raising storms of wind and rain. You ordered for his
killing and told us that he had turned unbeliever. We admit that he has
been killed but under your orders and the real Killer is one who ordered
it. Nevertheless, neither the sky fell over us nor did the sun and moon
fall into eclipse. Certainly people have paid allegiance to one who can
ward off the enemy with power and grandeur, does not allow swords to
come near him and loosens the twist of the rope, that is, subdues the
enemy. He is always fully armed for combat and the faithful is never
like the traitor. However, when she reached Mecca with a passion for
vengeance she began rousing the people to avenge \`Uthman's blood by
circulating stories of his having been victimised. The first to respond
to this call was \`Abdullah ibn \`Amir al-Hadrami who had been the
governor of Mecca in \`Uthman's reign and with him Marwan ibn al-Hakam,
Sa\`id ibn al-\`As and other Umayyads rose to support her. On the other
side Talhah ibn \`Ubaydillah and az-Zubayr ibn al-\`Awwam also reached
Mecca from Medina. From Yemen Ya\`la ibn Munabbih who had been governor
there during \`Uthman's caliphate and the former governor of Basrah,
\`Abdullah ibn \`Amir ibn Kurayz also reached there, and joining
together began preparing their plans. Battle had been decided upon but
discussion was about the venue of confrontation. \`A'ishah's opinion was
to make Medina the venue of the battle but some people opposed and held
that it was difficult to deal with Medinites, and that some other place
should be chosen as the venue. At last after much discussion it was
decided to march towards Basrah as there was no dearth of men to support
the cause. Consequently on the strength of \`Abdullah ibn \`Amir's
countless wealth, and the offer of six hundred thousand Dirhams and six
hundred camels by Ya\`la ibn Munabbih they prepared an army of three
thousand and set off to Basrah. There was a small incident on the way on
account of which \`A'ishah refused to advance further. What happened was
that at a place she heard the barking of dogs and enquired from the
camel driver the name of the place. He said it was Haw'ab. On hearing
this name she recalled the Prophet's admonition when he had said to his
wives, "I wish I could know at which of you the dogs of Haw'ab would
bark." So when she realised that she herself was that one she got the
camel seated by patting and expressed her intention to abandon the
march. But the device of her companions saved the deteriorating
situation. \`Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr swore to assure her that it was not
Haw'ab, Talhah seconded him and for her further assurance also sent for
fifty persons to stand witness to it. When all the people were on one
side what could a single woman do by opposing. Eventually they were
successful and \`A'ishah resumed her forward march with the same
enthusiasm. When this army reached Basrah, people were first amazed to
see the riding animal of \`A'ishah. Jariyah ibn Qudamah came forward and
said, "O' mother of the faithful, the assassination of \`Uthman was one
tragedy but the greater tragedy is that you have come out on this cursed
camel and ruined your honour and esteem. It is better that you should
get back." But since neither the incident at Haw'ab could deter her nor
could the Qur'anic injunction: "Keep sitting in your houses" (33:33)
stop her, what effect could these voices produce. Consequently, she
disregarded all this. When this army tried to enter the city the
Governor of Basrah \`Uthman ibn Hunayf came forward to stop them and
when the two parties came face to face they drew their swords out of the
sheaths and pounced upon each other. When a good number had been killed
from either side \`A'ishah intervened on the basis of her influence and
the two groups agreed that till the arrival of Amir al-mu'minin the
existing administration should continue and \`Uthman ibn Hunayf should
continue on his post. But only two days had elapsed when they made a
nightly attack on \`Uthman ibn Hunayf, killed forty innocent persons,
beat \`Uthman ibn Hunayf, plucked every hair of his beard, took him in
their custody and shut him up. Then they attacked public treasury and
while ransacking it killed twenty persons on the spot, and beheaded
fifty more after arresting them. Then they attacked the grain store,
whereupon an elderly noble of Basrah Hukaym ibn Jabalah could not
control himself and reaching there with his men said to \`Abdullah ibn
az-Zubayr, "Spare some of this grain for the city's populace. After all
there should be a limit to oppression. You have spread killing and
destruction all round and put \`Uthman ibn Hunayf in confinement. For
Allah's sake keep off these ruining activities and release \`Uthman ibn
Hunayf. Is there no fear of Allah in your hearts?" Ibn az-Zubayr said,
"This is vengeance of \`Uthman's life." Hukaym ibn Jabalah retorted,
"Were those who have been killed assassins of \`Uthman? By Allah, if I
had supporters and comrades I should have certainly avenged the blood of
these Muslims whom you have killed without reason." Ibn az-Zubayr
replied, "We shall not give anything out of this grain, nor will
\`Uthman ibn Hunayf be released." At last the battle raged between these
two parties but how could a few individuals deal with such a big force?
The result was that Hukaym ibn Jabalah, his son al-Ashraf ibn Hukaym ibn
Jabalah, his brother ar-Ri'l ibn Jabalah and seventy persons of his
tribe were killed. In short, killing and looting prevailed all round.
Neither anyone's life was secure nor was there any way to save one's
honour or property. When Amir al-mu'minin was informed of the march to
Basrah he set out to stop it with a force which consisted of seventy of
those who had taken part in the battle of Badr and four hundred out of
those companions who had the honour of being present at the Allegiance
of Ridwan (Divine Pleasure). When he stopped at the stage of Dhiqar he
sent his son Hasan (p.b.u.h.) and \`Ammar ibn Yasir to Kufah to invite
its people to fighting. Consequently, despite interference of Abu Musa
al-Ash\`ari seven thousand combatants from there joined Amir al-
mu'minin's army. He left that place after placing the army under various
commanders. Eye witnesses state that when this force reached near Basrah
first of all a contingent of ansar appeared foremost. Its standard was
held by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. After it appeared another contingent of
1000 whose commander was Khuzaymah ibn Thabit al-Ansari. Then another
contingent came in sight. Its standard was borne by Abu Qatadah ibn
ar-Rabi\`. Then a crowd of a thousand old and young persons was seen.
They had signs of prostration on their foreheads and veil of fear of
Allah on their face. It seemed as if they were standing before the
Divine Glory on the Day of Judgement. Their Commander rode a dark horse,
was dressed in white, had black turban on his head and was reciting the
Qur'an loudly. This was \`Ammar ibn Yasir. Then another contingent
appeared. Its standard was in the hand of Qays ibn Sa\`d ibn \`Ubadah.
Then an army came to sight. Its leader wore white dress and had a black
turban on his head. He was so handsome that all eyes centred around him.
This was \`Abdullah ibn \`Abbas. Then followed a contingent of the
companions of the Prophet. Their standard bearer was Qutham ibn
al-\`Abbas. Then after the passing of a few contingents a big crowd was
seen, wherein there was such a large number of spears that they were
overlapping and flags of numerous colours were flying. Among them a big
and lofty standard was seen with distinctive position. Behind it was
seen a rider guarded by sublimity and greatness. His sinews were
well-developed and eyes were cast downwards. His awe and dignity was
such that no one could look at him. This was the Ever Victorious Lion of
Allah namely \`Ali ibn Abi Talib (p.b.u.h.). On his right and left were
Hasan and Husayn (p.b.u.t.). In front of him Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah
walked in slow steps carrying the banner of victory and glory, and on
the back were the young men of Banu Hashim, the people of Badr and
\`Abdullah ibn Ja\`far ibn Abi Talib. When this army reached the place
az-Zawiyah, Amir al-mu'minin alighted from the horse, and after
performing four rak\`ah of prayer put his cheeks on the ground. When he
lifted his head the ground was drenched with tears and the tongue was
uttering these words: O' Sustainer of earth, heaven and the high
firmament, this is Basrah. Fill our lap with its good and protect us
from its evils. Then proceeding forward he got down in the battle-field
of Jamal where the enemy was already camping. First of all Amir
al-mu'minin announced in his army that no one should attack another, nor
take the initiative. Saying this he came in front of the opposite army
and said to Talhah and az-Zubayr, "You ask \`A'ishah by swearing in the
name of Allah and His prophet whether I am not free from the blame of
\`Uthman's blood, and whether I used the same words for him which you
used to say, and whether I pressurised you for allegiance or you swore
it of your own free will." Talhah got exasperated at these words but
az-Zubayr relented, and Amir al-mu'minin turned back after it, and
giving the Qur'an to Muslim (a young man from the tribe of \`Abd Qays)
sent him towards them to pronounce to them the verdict of the Qur'an.
But people took both of them within aim and covered this godly man with
their arrows. Then \`Ammar ibn Yasir went to canvass and convince them
and caution them with the consequences of war but his words were also
replied by arrows. Till now Amir al-mu'minin had not allowed an attack
as a result of which the enemy continued feeling encouraged and went on
raining arrows constantly. At last with the dying of a few valiant
combatants consternation was created among Amir al-mu'minin's ranks and
some people came with a few bodies before him and said, "O' Commander of
the faithful you are not allowing us to fight while they are covering us
with arrows. How long can we let them make our bosoms the victim of
their arrows, and remain handfolded at their excesses?" At this Amir
al-mu'minin did show anger but acting with restraint and endurance, came
to the enemy in that very form without wearing armour or any arm and
shouted, "Where is az-Zubayr?" At first az-Zubayr hesitated to come
forward but he noticed that Amir al-mu'minin had no arms he came out.
Amir al-mu'minin said to him "O' az-Zubayr, you must remember that one
day the Prophet told you that you would fight with me and wrong and
excess would be on your side." az-Zubayr replied that he had said so.
Then Amir al-mu'minin enquired "Why have you come then?" He replied that
his memory had missed it and if he had recollected it earlier he would
not have come that way. Amir al-mu'minin said, "Well, now you have
recollected it" and he replied, "Yes." Saying this he went straight to
\`A'ishah and told her that he was getting back. She asked him the
reason and he replied, "\`Ali has reminded me a forgotten matter. I had
gone astray, but now I have come on the right path and would not fight
\`Ali ibn Abi Talib at any cost." \`A'ishah said, "You have caught fear
of the swords of the sons of \`Abd al-Muttalib." He said, "No" and
saying this he turned the reins of his horse. However, it is gratifying
that some consideration was accorded to the Prophet's saying, for at
Haw'ab even after recollection of the Prophet's words no more than
transient effect was taken of it. On returning after this conversation
Amir al-mu'minin observed that they had attacked the right and left
flanks of his army. Noticing this Amir al-mu'minin said, "Now the plea
has been exhausted. Call my son Muhammad." When he came Amir al-mu'minin
said, "My son, attack them now." Muhammad bowed his head and taking the
standard proceeded to the battle-field. But arrows were falling in such
exuberance that he had to stop. When Amir al-mu'minin saw this he called
out at him, "Muhammad, why don't you advance?" He said, "Father, in this
shower of arrows there is no way to proceed. Wait till the violence of
arrows subsides." He said, "No, thrust yourself in the arrows and spears
and attack." Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah advanced a little but the
archers so surrounded him that he had to hold his steps. On seeing this
a frown appeared on Amir al-mu'minin's fore-head and getting forward he
hit the sword's handle on the Muhammad's back and said, "This is the
effect of your mother's veins." Saying this he took the standard from
his hands and folding up his sleeves made such and attack that a tumult
was created in the enemy's ranks from one end to the other. To whichever
row he turned, it became clear and to whatever side he directed himself
bodies were seen falling and heads rolling in the hoofs of horses. When
after convulsing the rows he returned to his position he said to
Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, "Look, my son, battle is fought like this."
Saying this he gave the standard to him and ordered him to proceed.
Muhammad advanced towards the enemy with a contingent of ansar. The
enemy also came out moving and balancing their spears. But the brave son
of the valiant father convulsed rows over rows while the other warriors
also made the battle-field glory and left heaps of dead bodies. From the
other side also there was full demonstration of spirit of sacrifice.
Dead bodies were falling one over the other but they continued
sacrificing their lives devotedly around the camel. Particularly the
condition of Banu Dabbah was that although their hands were being
severed from the elbows for holding the reins of the camel, and bosoms
were being pierced yet they had the following battle-song on their
tongues: a) To us death is sweeter than honey. We are Banu Dabbah, camel
rearers. b) We are sons of death when death comes. We announce the death
of \`Uthman with the edges of spears. c) Give us back our chief and
there is an end to it. The low character and ignorance from faith of
these Banu Dabbah, can be well understood by that one incident which
al-Mada'ini has narrated. He writes that in Basrah there was a man with
mutilated ear. He asked him its reason when he said, "I was watching the
sight of dead bodies in the battle-field of Jamal when I saw a wounded
man who sometimes raised his head and sometimes dashed it back on the
ground. I approached near. Then the following two verses were on his
lips: a) Our mother pushed us into the deep waters of death and did not
get back till we had thoroughly drunk. b) By misfortune we obeyed Banu
Taym who are none but slave men and slave girls. "I told him it was not
the time to recite verses; he should rather recall Allah and recite the
kalimat ash-shahadah (verse of testimony). On my saying this he saw me
with angry looks and uttering a severe abuse and said, "You are asking
me to recite kalimat ash-shahadah, get frightened at the last moment and
show impatience." I was astonished to hear this and decided to return
without saying anything further. When he saw me returning he said,
"Wait; for your sake I am prepared to recite, but teach me." I drew
close to teach him the kalimah when he asked me to get closer. When I
got closer he caught my ear with his teeth and did not leave it till he
tore it from the root. I did not think it proper to molest a dying man
and was about to get back abusing and cursing him when he asked me to
listen one more thing. I agreed to listen lest he had an unsatisfied
wish. He said that when I should get to my mother and she enquired who
had bitten my ear I should say that it was done by \`Umayr ibn al-Ahlab
ad-Dabbi who had been deceived by a woman aspiring to become the
commander of the faithful (head of the state)." However, when the
dazzling lightning of swords finished the lives of thousands of persons
and hundreds of Banu Azd and Banu Dabbah were killed for holding the
rein of the camel, Amir al-mu'minin ordered, "Kill the camel for it is
Satan." Saying this he made such a severe attack that the cries of
"Peace" and "Protection" rose from all round. When he reached near the
camel he ordered Bujayr ibn Duljah to kill the camel at once.
Consequently, Bujayr hit him with such full might that the camel fell in
agony on the side of its bosom. No sooner than the camel fell the
opposite army took to heels and the carrier holding \`A'ishah was left
lonely and unguarded. The companion of Amir al-mu'minin took control of
the carrier and under orders of Amir al-mu'minin, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
escorted \`A'ishah to the house of Safiyyah bint al-Harith. This
encounter commenced on the 10th of Jumada ath-thaniyah, 36 A.H., in the
afternoon and came to an end the same evening. In it from Amir
al-mu'minin's army of twenty two thousand, one thousand and seventy or
according to another version five hundred persons were killed as martyrs
while from \`A'ishah's army of thirty thousand, seventeen thousand
persons were killed, and the Prophet's saying, "That people who assigned
their affairs (of state) to a woman would never prosper" was fully
corroborated. (al-Imamah wa's-siyasah; Muruj adh-dhahab; al-\`Iqd
al-farid; at-Tarikh, at Tabari)

[^2]: Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written that as prophesied by Amir
al-mu'minin, Basrah was flooded twice - once in the days of al-Qadir
Bi’llah and once in the reign of al-Qa'im bi Amri'l-lah and the state of
flooding was just this that while the whole city was under water but the
top ends of the mosque were seen about the surface of the water and
looked like a bird sitting on the side of its bosom.
