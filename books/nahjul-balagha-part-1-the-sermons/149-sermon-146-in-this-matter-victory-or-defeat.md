In this matter, victory or defeat is not dependent on the smallness or
greatness of forces. It is Allah's religion which He has raised above
all faiths, and His army which He has mobilised and extended, till it
has reached the point where it stands now, and has arrived its present
positions. We hold a promise from Allah, and He will fulfil His promise
and support His army.

The position of the head of government is that of the thread for beads,
as it connects them and keeps them together. If the thread is broken,
they will disperse and be lost, and will never come together again. The
Arabs today, even though small in number are big because of Islam and
strong because of unity. You should remain like the axis for them, and
rotate the mill (of government) with (the help of) the Arabs, and be
their root. Avoid battle, because if you leave this place the Arabs will
attack you from all sides and directions till the unguarded places left
behind by you will become more important than those before you.

الْيَومَ وَإِنْ كَانُوا قَلِيلاً، فَهُمْ كَثِيرُونَ بَالاْسْلاَمِ،
عَزِيزُونَ بَالاجْتِماعِ! فَكُنْ قُطْباً، وَاسْتَدِرِ الرَّحَا

شَخَصْتَ مِنْ هذِهِ الاَرْضِ انْتَقَضَتْ عَلَيْكَ الْعَرَبُ مِنْ
أَطْرَافِهَا وَأَقْطَارِهَا، حَتَّى يَكُونَ مَا تَدَعُ وَرَاءَكَ مِنَ
الْعَوْرَاتِ أَهَمَّ إِلَيْكَ مِمَّا بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ.

If the Persians see you tomorrow they will say, "He is the root (chief)
of Arabia. If we do away with him we will be in peace." In this way this
will heighten their eagerness against you and their keenness to aim at
you. You say that they have set out to fight against the Muslims. Well,
Allah detests their setting out more than you do, and He is more capable
of preventing what He detests. As regards your idea about their (large)
number, in the past we did not fight on the strength of large numbers
but we fought on the basis of Allah's support and assistance.

إِنَّ الاَعَاجِمَ إِنْ يَنْظُرُوا إِلَيْكَ غَداً يَقُولُوا: هذا أَصْلُ
الْعَرَبِ، فَإِذَا اقْتَطَعْتُمُوهُ اسْتَرَحْتُمْ، فَيْكُونُ ذلِكَ
أَشَدَّ لِكَلَبِهِمْ عَلَيْكَ، وَطَمَعِهِمْ فِيكَ. فَأَمَّا مَا
ذَكَرْتَ مِنْ مَسِيرِ الْقَوْمِ إِلَى قِتَالِ المُسْلِمِينَ، فَإِنَّ
اللهَ سُبْحَانَهُ هُوَ أَكْرَهُ لِمَسِيرِهِمْ مِنْكَ، وَهُوَ أَقْدَرُ
عَلَى تَغْيِيرِ مَا يَكْرَهُ . وَأَمَّا مَا ذَكَرْتَ مِنْ عَدَدِهِمْ،
فَإِنَّا لَمْ نَكُنْ نُقَاتِلُ فِيَما مَضَى بِالْكَثْرَةِ، وَإِنَّمَا
كُنَّا نُقَاتِلُ بِالنَّصْرِ وَالْمَعُونَةِ!

[^1]: When some people advised Caliph \`Umar to partake in the battle of
al-Qadisiyyah or Nahawand, he finding it against his personal
inclination, thought it necessary to consult Amir al-mu'minin, so that
if he advised against it he would plead before others that he had stayed
back on Amir al-mu'minin's advice, but also if he advised partaking in
the battle some other excuse would be found. However, unlike others,
Amir al-mu'minin advised him to stay back. The other people had advised
him to join in fighting, because the Holy Prophet did not send only
others to fight but took part in it himself as well, keeping his close
relations also with him. What Amir al-mu'minin had in view was that
\`Umar's presence in the battle could not be beneficial to Islam, but
rather his staying back would save the Muslims from dispersion. Amir
al-mu'minin's view that "the position of the head of government is that
of the axis around which the system of the government rotates" is a
point of principle and does not concern any particular personality.
Whether the ruler is a Muslim or an unbeliever, just or despotic,
virtuous or vicious, for the administration of the state his presence is
a necessity, as Amir al-mu'minin has explained elsewhere at greater
length: The fact is that there is no escape for men from a ruler good or
bad. Faithful persons perform (good) acts in his rule while the
unfaithful enjoys (worldly) benefits in it. During the rule, Allah will
carry everything to its end. Through the ruler tax is collected, the
enemy is fought, roads are protected and the right of the weak is taken
from the strong till the virtuous enjoy peace and are allowed protection
from (the oppression of) the wicked. (Sermon 40) The words which Amir
al-mu'minin uttered in his advice are not indicative of any quality of
Caliph \`Umar except his being the ruler. There is no doubt that he held
worldly authority, irrespective of the question of whether it was
secured in the right way or wrong way. And where there is authority
there is centring of people's affairs. That is why Amir al-mu'minin said
that if \`Umar would go out the Arabs would follow him in large numbers
towards the battlefield, because when the ruler is on the march the
people will not like to stay behind. The result of their going would be
that city after city would become vacant, while the enemy will infer
from their reaching the battlefield that the Islamic cities are lying
vacant, and that if these people were repulsed no assistance would reach
the Muslims from the centre. Again, if the ruler were killed the army
would disperse automatically, because the ruler is as its foundation.
When the foundation is shaken the walls cannot remain standing. The word
"aslu'l-\`Arab" (the root chief) of Arabia has not been used by Amir
al-mu'minin as his own but he has taken it from the Persians. Obviously
in his capacity as the head of the State, Caliph \`Umar was, in their
view, the chief of Arabia. Besides, the reference is to the country, not
to Islam or Muslims, so that there is no suggestion of any importance
for him from the Islamic point of view. When Amir al-mu'minin pointed
out to Caliph \`Umar that on his reaching there the Persians would aim
at him, and that if he fell into their hands they would not spare him
without killing, although such words would have touched the brave to the
quick and would have heightened their spirits, \`Umar liked the advice
to stay back and thought it better to keep himself away from the flames
of battle. If this advice had not been in accord with his personal
inclination he would not have received it so heartily and would have
tried to argue that the administration of the country could be
maintained by leaving a deputy. Again when other people had already
advised him to go out, what was the need for consulting Amir al-mu'minin
except to get an excuse to stay back.
