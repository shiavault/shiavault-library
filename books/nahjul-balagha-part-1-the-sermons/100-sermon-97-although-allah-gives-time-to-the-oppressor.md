*Admonishing his own companions [about his companions and the companions
of the Prophet]* [^1]

Although Allah gives time to the oppressor, His catch would not spare
him. Allah watches him on the passage of his way and the position of
that which suffocates the throats.

By Allah in Whose power my life lies, these people (Mu\`awiyah and his
men) will overcome you not because they have a better right than you but
because of their hastening towards the wrong with their leader and your
slowness about my right (to be followed).

لَهُ بَالمِرْصَادِ عَلَى مَجَازِ طَرِيقِهِ، وَبِمَوْضعِ الشَّجَا مِنْ
مَسَاغِ رِيقِهِ. أَمَا وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ، لَيَظْهَرَنَّ
هؤُلاَءِ الْقَوْمُ عَلَيْكُمْ، لَيْسَ لاِنَّهُمْ أَوْلَى بِالْحَقِّ

وَإِبْطَائِكُمْ عَنْ حَقِّي.

People are afraid of the oppression of their rulers while I fear the
oppression of my subjects. I called you for war but you did not come. I
warned you but you did not listen. I called you secretly as well as
openly, but you did not respond. I gave you sincere counsel, but you did
not accept it. Are you present like the absent, and slaves like masters?

I recite before you points of wisdom but you turn away from them, and I
advise you with far reaching advice but you disperse away from it. I
rouse you for *jihad* against the people of revolt but before I come to
the end of my speech, I see you disperse like the sons of Saba.[^2] You
return to your places and deceive one another by your counsel. I
straighten you in the morning but you are back to me in the evening as
curved as the back of a bow. The sraightener has become weary while
those to be straightened have become incorrigible.

O those whose bodies are present but whose wits are absent, whose wishes
are scattered, and whose rulers are afflicted by them. Your leader obeys
Allah but you disobey him while the leader of the people of Syria
(ash-Sham) disobeys Allah but they obey him. By Allah, I wish Mu\`awiyah
exchanges with me like Dinars with Dirhams, so that he takes from me ten
of you and gives me one from them.

O people of Kufah, I have experienced in you three things and two
others: you are deaf in spite of having ears, dumb in spite of speaking,
and blind in spite of having eyes. You are neither true supporters in
combat nor dependable brothers in distress. Your hands may be soiled
with earth. O examples of those camels whose herdsman has disappeared,
if they are collected together from one side they disperse from the
other. By Allah, I see you in my imagination that if war becomes intense
and action is in full swing you would run away from the son of Abi Talib
like the woman who becomes naked in the front. I am certainly on clear
guidance from my Lord (Allah) and on the path of my Prophet and I am on
the right path which I adhere to regularly.

Look at the people of the Prophet's family. Adhere to their direction.
Follow their footsteps because they would never let you out of guidance,
and never throw you into destruction. If they sit down, you sit down,
and if they rise up you rise up. Do not go ahead of them, as you would
thereby go astray and go not lag behind of them as you would thereby be
ruined.

يُعِيدُوكُمْ فِي رَدىً، فَإِنْ لَبَدُوا فَالْبُدُوا، وَإِنْ نَهَضُوا
فَانْهَضُوا، وَلاَ تَسْبِقُوهُمْ فَتَضِلُّوا، وَلاَ تَتَأَخَّرُوا

I have seen the companions of the Prophet but I do not find anyone
resembling them. They began the day with dust on the hair and face (in
hardship of life) and passed the night in prostration and standing in
prayers. Sometimes they put down their foreheads and sometimes their
cheeks. With the recollection of their resurrection it seemed as though
they stood on live coal. It seemed that in between their eyes there were
signs like knees of goats, resulting from long prostrations. When Allah
was mentioned their eyes flowed freely till their shirt collars were
drenched. They trembled for fear of punishment and hope of reward as the
tree trembles on the day of stormy wind.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

لَقَدْ رَأَيْتُ أَصْحَابَ مُحَمَّد (صلى الله عليه وآله)، فَمَا أَرَى

غُبْراً، قَدْ بَاتُوا سُجّداً وَقِيَاماً، يُرَاوِحُونَ بَيْنَ

تَبُلَّ جُيُوبَهُمْ، وَمَادُوا كَمَا يَمِيدُ الشَّجَرُ يَوْمَ الرِّيحِ

[^1]: In the atmosphere that had been created soon after the Prophet the
Ahlul Bayt (members of his family) had no course except to remain
secluded as a result of which world has remained ignorant of their real
qualities and unacquainted with their teachings and attainments, and to
belittle them and keeping them away from authority has been considered
as the greatest service to Islam. If \`Uthman's open misdeeds had not
given a chance to the Muslims to wake up and open their eyes there would
have been no question of allegiance to Amir al-mu'minin and temporal
authority would have retained the same course as it had so far followed.
But all those who could be named for the purpose had no courage to come
forward because of their own shortcomings while Mu\`awiyah was sitting
in his capital away from the centre. In these circumstances there was
none except Amir al-mu'minin who could be looked at. Consequently
people's eyes hovered around him and the same common people who,
following the direction of the wind, had been swearing allegiance to
others jumped at him for swearing allegiance. Nevertheless, this
allegiance was not on the count that they regarded his Caliphate as from
Allah and him as an Imam (Divine Leader) to obey whom was obligatory. It
was rather under their own principles which were known as democratic or
consultative. However, there was one group who was swearing allegiance
to him as a religious obligation regarding his Caliphate as determined
by Allah. Otherwise, the majority regarded him a ruler like the other
Caliphs, and as regards precedence, on the fourth position, or at the
level of the common men after the three caliphs. Since the people, the
army, and the civil servants had been impressed by the beliefs and
actions of the previous rulers and immersed in their ways whenever they
found anything against their liking they fretted and frowned, evaded war
and were ready to rise in disobedience and revolt. Further, just as
among those who fought in jihad with the Prophet there were some seekers
of this world and others of the next world, in the same way here too
there was no dearth of worldly men who were, in appearance, with Amir
al-mu'minin but actually they had connections with Mu\`awiyah who has
promised some of them positions and had extended to others temptation of
wealth. To hold them as Shi\`ahs of Amir al-mu'minin and to blame
Shi\`ism for this reason is closing the eyes to facts, because the
beliefs of these people would be the same as of those who regarded Amir
al-mu'minin fourth in the series. Ibn Abi'l-Hadid throws light on the
beliefs of these persons in clear words: Whoever observes minutely the
events during the period of Caliphate of Amir al-mu'minin would know
that Amir al-mu'minin had been brought to bay because those who knew his
real position were very few, and the swarming majority did not bear that
belief about him which was obligatory to have. They gave precedence to
the previous Caliphs over him and held that the criterion of precedence
was Caliphate, and in this matter those coming later followed the
predecessors, and argued that if the predecessors had not the knowledge
that the previous Caliphs had precedence over Amir al-mu'minin they
would not have preferred them to him. Rather, these people knew and took
Amir al-mu'minin as a citizen and subject. Most of those who fought in
his company did so on grounds of prestige or Arab partisanship, not on
the ground of religion or belief. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol.7, p.72)

[^2]: The progeny of Saba' ibn Yashjub ibn Ya\`rub ibn Qahtan is known
as the tribe of Saba'. When these people began to falsify prophets then
to shake them Allah sent to them a flood of water by which their gardens
were submerged and they left their houses and property to settle down in
different cities. This proverb arose out of this event and it is now
applied wherever people so disperse that there can be no hope of their
joining together again.
