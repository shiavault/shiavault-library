Sermon 92: Leave me and find someone else ...
=============================================

When people decided to swear allegiance[^1] at Amir al-mu'minin's hand
after the murder of \`Uthman, he said:

  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">

لمّا أراده الناس على البيعة بعد قتل عثمان
  </p>
</blockquote>

Leave me and seek some one else. We are facing a matter which has
(several) faces and colours, which neither hearts can stand nor
intelligence can accept. Clouds are hovering over the sky, and faces are
not discernible. You should know that if I respond to you I would lead
you as I know and would not listen to the utterance of any speaker or
the reproof of any reprover. If you leave me then I am the same as you
are. It is possible I would listen to and obey whomever you make in
charge of your affairs. I am better for you as a counsellor than as
chief.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
دَعُوني وَالْـتَمِسُوا غَيْرِي; فإِنَّا مُسْتَقْبِلُونَ أَمْراً لَهُ
وُجُوهٌ وَأَلْوَانٌ; لاَ تَقُومُ لَهُ الْقُلُوبُ، وَلاَ تَثْبُتُ
عَلَيْهِ الْعُقُولُ، وَإِنَّ الاْفَاقَ قَدْ أَغَامَتْ، وَالْـمَحَجَّةَ
قَدْ تَنَكَّرَتْ. وَاعْلَمُوا أَنِّي إنْ أَجَبْتُكُمْ رَكِبْتُ بِكُمْ
مَا أَعْلَمُ، وَلَمْ أُصْغِ إِلَى قَوْلِ الْقَائِلِ وَعَتْبِ
الْعَاتِبِ، وَإِنْ تَرَكْتُمُونِي فَأَنَا كَأَحَدِكُمْ; وَلَعَلِّي
أَسْمَعُكُمْ وَأَطْوَعُكُمْ لِمنْ وَلَّيْتُمُوهُ أَمْرَكُمْ، وَأَنَا
لَكُمْ وَزِيراً، خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ مِنِّي أَمِيراً!

[^1]: When with the murder of \`Uthman the seat of Caliphate became
vacant, Muslims began to look at \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) whose peaceful
conduct, adherence to principles, and politia lacumen had been witnessed
by them to a great extent during this long period. Consequently, they
rushed for swearing allegiance in the same way as a traveller who had
lost his way and catches sight of the objective would have rushed
towards it, as the historian at-Tabari (in at-Tarikh, vol .I, pp. 3066,
3067, 3076) records: People thronged on Amir al-mu'minin and said, "We
want to swear allegiance to you and you see what troubles are befalling
Islam and how we are being tried about the near ones of the Prophet."
But Amir al-mu'minin declined to accede to their request whereupon these
people raised a hue and cry and began to shout loudly, "O' Abu'l-Hasan,
do you not witness the ruination of Islam or see the advancing flood of
unruliness and mischief? Do you have no fear of Allah?" Even then Amir
al-mu'minin showed no readiness to consent because he was noticing that
the effects of the atmosphere that had come into being after the Prophet
had overcome hearts and minds of the people, selfishness and lust for
power had become rooted in them, their thinking affected by materialism
and they had become habituated to treating government as the means for
securing their ends. Now they would like to materialise the Divine
Caliphate too and play with it. In these circumstances it would be
impossible to change the mentalities or turn the direction of
temperaments. In addition to these ideas he had also seen the end in
view that these people should get further time to think over so that on
frustration of their material ends hereafter they should not say that
the allegiance had been sworn by them under a temporary expediency and
that thought had not been given to it, just as \`Umar's idea was about
the first Caliphate, which appears from his statement that: Abu Bakr's
Caliphate came into being without thought but Allah saved us from its
mischief. If anyone repeats such an affair you should kill him.
(as-Sahih, al-Bukhari, vol 8, pp.210, 211; al-Musnad, Ahmad ibn Hanbal,
vol.1, p.55; at-Tabari, vol.1, p.l822; Ibn al-Athir, vol.2, p.327; Ibn
Hisham, vol.4, pp.308-309; Ibn Kathir, vol.5, p.246) In short, when
their insistence increased beyond limits, Amir al-mu'minin delivered
this sermon wherein he clarified that "If you want me for your worldly
ends, then I am not ready to serve as your instrument. Leave me and
select someone else who may fulfil your ends. You have seen my past life
that I am not prepared to follow anything except the Qur'an and sunnah
and would not give up this principle for securing power. If you select
someone else I would pay regard to the laws of the state and the
constitution as a peaceful citizen should do. I have not at any stage
tried to disrupt the collective existence of the Muslims by inciting
revolt. The same will happen now. Rather, just as keeping the common
good in view I have hitherto been giving correct advice, I would not
grudge doing the same. If you let me in the same position it would be
better for your worldly ends, because in that case I won't have power in
my hands so that I could stand in the way of your worldly affairs, and
create an impediment against your hearts' wishes. However, if you are
determined on swearing allegiance on my hand, bear in mind that if you
frown or speak against me I would force you to tread on the path of
right, and in the matter of the right I would not care for anyone. If
you want to swear allegiance even at this, you can satisfy your wish."
The impression Amir al-mu'minin had formed about these people is fully
corroborated by later events. Consequently, when those who had sworn
allegiance with worldly motives did not succeed in their objectives they
broke away and rose against his government with baseless allegations.
