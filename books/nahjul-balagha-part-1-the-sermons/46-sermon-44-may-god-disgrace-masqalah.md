Sermon 44: May God disgrace Masqalah, ...
=========================================

*When Masqalah*[^1] *ibn Hubayrah ash-Shaybani fled to Mu\`awiyah
because he had purchased some prisoners of Banu Najiyah from an
executive of Amir al-mu’minin, but when he demanded the price the latter
avoided and ran to Syria, Amir al-mu’minin said:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لمّا هرب مَصْقَلة بنُ هُبيرة الشيباني إلى معاوية، وكان قد ابتاع سَبْيَ
بني ناجية من عامل أميرالمؤمنين (عليه السلام) وأعتقهم، فلمّا طالبه(عليه
السلام) بالمال خاس به وهرب إلى الشام،
  </p>
</blockquote>

Allah may be bad to Masqalah. He acted like the noble but fled away like
a slave. Before his admirer could speak (about him) he silenced him and
before his eulogist could testify to his good deeds he closed his mouth.
If he had stayed behind we would have taken from him what he could
easily pay and waited for the balance till his money increased.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قَبَّحَ اللهُ مَصْقَلَةَ! فَعَلَ فِعْلَ السَّادَةِ، وَفَرَّ فِرَارَ
الْعَبِيدِ! فَمَا أَنْطَقَ مَادِحَهُ حَتَّى أَسْكَتَهُ، وَلاَ صَدَّقَ
وَاصِفَهُ حَتَّى بَكَّتَهُ، وَلَو أَقَامَ لاَخَذْنَا مَيْسُورَهُ،
وَانْتَظَرْنا بِمَالِهِ وُفُورَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

[^1]: When after Arbitration the Kharijites rose, a man of Bani Najiyah
from them named al-Khirrit ibn Rashid an-Naji stood up for instigating
people and set off towards al-Mada'in with a group killing and
marauding. Amir al-mu'minin sent Ziyad ibn Khasafah with three hundred
men to check him. When the two forces met at al-Mada'in they attacked
each other with swords. Only one encounter or so had taken place when
the gloom of evening prevailed and the battle had to be stopped. When
morning appeared Ziyad's men noticed that five dead bodies of the
Kharijites were lying and they themselves had cleared off the
battlefield. Seeing this Ziyad set off for Basrah along with his men.
There he came to know that the Kharijites had gone to Ahwaz. Ziyad did
not move onwards for paucity of force and informed Amir al-mu'minin of
it. Amir al-mu'minin called back Ziyad and sent Ma\`qil ibn Qays
ar-Riyah'i with two thousand experienced combatants towards Ahwaz and
wrote to the governor of Basrah \`Abdullah ibn \`Abbas to send two
thousand swordsmen of Basrah for the help of Ma\`qil. Consequently, the
contingent from Basrah also joined them at Ahwaz and after proper
organisation they got ready for attacking the enemy. But al-Khirrit
marched on along with his men to the hills of Ramhurmuz. These people
also followed him and overtook him near these hills. Both arrayed their
forces and started attacking each other. The result of this encounter
was also that three hundred and seventy Kharijites were killed in the
battlefield while the rest ran away. Ma\`qil informed Amir al-mu'minin
of his performance and of the enemy's running away when Amir al-mu'minin
directed him to chase them and so to shatter their power that they
should not be able to raise heads again. On receipt of this order he
moved on and overtook him on the coast of the Persian gulf where
al-Khirrit had by persuasion secured the co-operation of the people and
enlisting men from here and there, had collected a considerable force.
When Ma\`qil reached there, he raised the flag of peace and announced
that those who had collected from here and there should get away. They
would not be molested. The effect of this announcement was that save for
his own community all others deserted him. He organised those very men
and commenced the battle but valorous combatants of Basrah and Kufah
displayed such excellent use of swords that in a short time one hundred
and seventy men of the insurgents were killed while an-Nu\`man ibn
Suhban ar-Rasib'i encountered al-Khirrit (ibn Rashid an-Naji) and
eventually felled him and killed him. Soon upon his fall the enemy lost
ground and they fled away from the battlefield. Thereafter Ma\`qil
collected all the men, women and children from their camps at one place.
From among them those who were Muslims were released after swearing of
allegiance. Those who had turned heretics were called upon to resume
Islam. Consequently except one old Christian all others secured release
by accepting Islam and this old man was killed. Then he took with him
those Christians of Bani Najiyah who had taken part in this revolt
together with their families. When Ma\`qil reached Ardashir Khurrah (a
city of Iran) these prisoners wailed and cried, before its governor
Masqalah ibn Hubayrah ash-Shaybani and beseeched humiliatively to do
something for their release. Masqalah sent word to Ma\`qil through Dhuhl
ibn al-Harith to sell these prisoners to him. Ma\`qil agreed and sold
those prisoners to him for five hundred thousand Dirhams and told him to
dispatch the price immediately to Amir al-mu'minin. He said that he was
sending the first instalment at once and the remaining instalments would
also be sent soon. When Ma\`qil met Amir al-mu'minin he related the
whole event before him. Amir al-mu'minin ratified this action and waited
for the price for some time, but Masqalah observed such deep silence as
if nothing was due from him. At last Amir al-mu'minin sent a messenger
to him and sent him word to either send the price or to come himself. On
Amir al-mu'minin's order he came to Kufah and on demand of the price
paid two hundred thousand Dirhams but to evade the balance went away to
Mu\`awiyah's who made him the governor of Tabarastan. When Amir
al-mu'minin came to know all this he spoke these words (as in this
sermon). Its sum total is that, "If he had stayed we would have been
considerate to him in demanding the price and would have waited for
improvement of his financial condition, but he fled away like slaves
after displaying a showy act. Talk about his high perseverance had just
started when people began to discuss his baseless and lowliness."
