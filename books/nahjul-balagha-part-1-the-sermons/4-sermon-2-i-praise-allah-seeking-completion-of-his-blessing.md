Arabia before proclamation of Prophethood

I praise Allah seeking completion of His Blessing, submitting to His
Glory and expecting safety from committing His sins. I invoke His help
being in need of His Sufficiency (of protection). He whom He guides does
not go astray, He with whom He is hostile gets no protection. He whom He
supports does not remain needy. Praise is most weighty of all that is
weighed and the most valuable of all that is treasured.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أحْمَدُهُ اسْتِتْماماً لِنِعْمَتِهِ، وَاسْتِسْلاَماً لِعِزَّتِهِ،
واسْتِعْصَاماً مِنْ مَعْصِيَتِهِ، وَأَسْتَعِينُهُ فَاقَةً إِلى
كِفَايَتِهِ، إِنَّهُ لاَ يَضِلُّ مَنْ هَدَاهُ، وَلا يَئِلُ مَنْ
عَادَاهُ، وَلا يَفْتَقِرُ مَنْ كَفَاهُ; فَإِنَّهُ أَرْجَحُ ما وُزِنَ،
وَأَفْضَلُ مَا خُزِنَ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I stand witness that there is no god but Allah the One. He has no like.
My testimony has been tested in its frankness, and its essence is our
belief. We shall cling to it for ever till we live and shall store it
for facing the tribulations that overtake us because it is the
foundation stone of Belief *(iman)* and the first step towards good
actions and Divine pleasure. It is the means to keep Satan away.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلهَ إِلاَّ اللهُ، شَهَادَةً مُمْتَحَناً
إِخْلاَصُهَا، مُعْتَقَداً مُصَاصُهَا، نَتَمَسَّكُ بها أَبَداً ما
أَبْقانَا، وَنَدَّخِرُهَا لاِهَاوِيلِ مَا يَلْقَانَا، فَإِنَّها
عَزيمَةُ الاْيمَانِ، وَفَاتِحَةُ الاْحْسَانِ، وَمَرْضَاةُ الرَّحْمنِ،
وَمَدْحَرَةُ الشَّيْطَانِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I also stand witness that Muhammad (S) is His slave and His Prophet.
Allah sent him with the illustrious religion, effective emblem, written
Book,[^1] effulgent light, sparkling gleam and decisive injunction in
order to dispel doubts, present clear proofs, administer warning through
signs and to warn of punishments. At that time people had fallen in
vices whereby the rope of religion had been broken, the pillars of
belief had been shaken, principles had been sacrileged, system had
become topsy turvy, openings were narrow, passage was dark, guidance was
unknown and darkness prevailed.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، أرْسَلَهُ بِالدِّينِ
المشْهُورِ، وَالعَلَمِ المأْثُورِ، وَالكِتَابِ المسْطُورِ، وَالنُّورِ
السَّاطِعِ، وَالضِّيَاءِ اللاَّمِعِ، وَالاَمْرِ الصَّادِعِ، إزَاحَةً
لِلشُّبُهَاتِ، وَاحْتِجَاجاً بِالبَيِّنَاتِ، وَتَحْذِيراً بِالايَاتِ،
وَتَخْويفاً بِالمَثُلاَتِ، وَالنَّاسُ في فِتَن انْجَذَمَ فِيها حَبْلُ
الدِّينِ، وَتَزَعْزَعَتْ سَوَارِي اليَقِينِ، وَاخْتَلَفَ النَّجْرُ،
وَتَشَتَّتَ الاْمْرُ، وَضَاقَ الْـمَخْرَجُ، وَعَمِيَ المَصْدَرُ،
فَالهُدَى خَامِلٌ، واَلعَمَى شَامِلٌ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Allah was being disobeyed, Satan was given support and Belief had been
forsaken. As a result the pillars of religion fell down, its traces
could not be discerned, its passages had been destroyed and its streets
had fallen into decay. People obeyed Satan and treaded his paths. They
sought water from his watering places. Through them Satan’s emblems got
flying and his standard was raised in vices which trampled the people
under their hoofs, and treaded upon them with their feet. The vices
stood on their toes (in full stature) and the people immersed in them
were strayed, perplexed, ignorant and seduced as though in a good
house[^2] with bad neighbours. Instead of sleep they had wakefulness and
for antimony they had tears in the eyes. They were in a land where the
learned were in bridle (keeping their mouths shut) while the ignorant
were honoured.

بِأَخْفَافِهَا، وَوَطِئَتْهُمْ بأَظْلاَفِهَا وَقَامَتْ عَلَى
سَنَابِكِهَا، فَهُمْ فِيهَا تَائِهُونَ حَائِرونَ جَاهِلُونَ
مَفْتُونُونَ، في خَيْرِ دَار، وَشَرِّ جِيرَان، نَوْمُهُمْ سُهُودٌ،
وَكُحْلُهُمْ دُمُوعٌ، بأَرْض عَالِمُها مُلْجَمٌ، وَجَاهِلُها مُكْرَمٌ.

In the same sermon Amir al-mu’minin referred to Al an-Nabi (the Household of the Holy Prophet) as under
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومنها: ويعني آل النبي ( صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)
  </p>
</blockquote>

They are the trustees of His secrets, shelter for His affairs, source of
knowledge about Him, centre of His wisdom, valleys for His books and
mountains of His religion. With them Allah straightened the bend of
religion’s back and removed the trembling of its limbs.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
هُمْ مَوْضِعُ سِرِّهِ، وَلَجَأُ أَمْرِهِ، وَعَيْبَةُ عِلْمِهِ،
وَمَوْئِلُ حُكْمِهِ، وَكُهُوفُ كُتُبِهِ، وَجِبَالُ دِينِه، بِهِمْ
أَقَامَ انْحِناءَ ظَهْرِهِ، وَأذْهَبَ ارْتِعَادَ فَرَائِصِهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

In the same Sermon he spoke about the hypocrites
------------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">

They sowed vices, watered them with deception and harvested destruction.

None in the Islamic community can be taken at par with the Progeny[^3]
of the Prophet (Ali Muhammad). One who was under their obligation cannot
be matched with them. They are the foundation of religion and pillar of
Belief. The forward runner has to turn back to them while the follower
has to overtake them. They possess the chief characteristics for
vicegerency. In their favour exists the will and succession (of the
Prophet). This is the time when right has returned to its owner and
diverted to its centre of return.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

لا يُقَاسُ بِآلِ مُحَمَّد (عليهم السلام) مِنْ هذِهِ الاُمَّةِ أَحَدٌ،

(3) Ibn \`Abd Rabbih, al-\`Iqd, III, 112;

(4) al-'Amidi, Ghurar, 331, 354;

(5) Ibn Talhah, Matalib, I.

[^1]: The Preserved Record.

[^2]: Good House means ‘Mecca’ while the bad neighbours mean the
‘Unbelievers of Quraysh.’

[^3]: About the Progeny of the Prophet Amir al-mu'minin has said that no
person in the world can be brought at par with them, nor can any one be
deemed their equal in sublimity, because the world is overladen with
their obligations and has been able to secure eternal blessings only
through their guidance. They are the corner stone and foundation of
religion and the sustenance for its life and survival. They are such
strong pillars of knowledge and belief that they can turn away the
stormy flow of doubt and suspicion. They are such middle course among
the paths of excess and backwardness that if some one goes far towards
excess and exaggeration or falls behind then unless he comes back or
steps forward to that middle course he cannot be on the path of Islam.
They possess all the characteristics which give the superiority in the
right for vicegerency and leadership. Consequently, no one else in the
ummah enjoys the right of patronage and guardianship. That is why the
Prophet declared them his vicegerents and successors. About will and
succession the commentator Ibn Abi'l-Hadid Mu\`tazili writes that there
can be no doubt about the vicegerency of Amir al-mu'minin but succession
cannot imply succession in position although the Shi\`ite sect has so
interpreted it. It rather implies succession of learning. Now, if
according to him succession is taken to imply succession in learning
even he does not seem to succeed in achieving his object, because even
by this interpretation the right of succeeding the Prophet does not
devolve on any other person. When it is agreed that learning is the most
essential requirement of khilafah (caliphate) because the most important
functions of the Prophet's Caliph consist of dispensation of justice,
solving problems of religious laws, clarifying intricacies and
administration of religious penalties. If these functions are taken away
from the Prophet's deputy his position will come down to that of a
worldly ruler. He cannot be regarded as the pivot of religious
authority. Therefore either we should keep governmental authority
separate from Prophet's vicegerency or accept the successor of Prophet's
knowledge to suit that position. The interpretation of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid
could be acceptable if Amir al-mu'minin had uttered this sentence alone,
but observing that it was uttered soon after \`Ali's (p.b.u.h.)
recognition as Caliph and just after it the sentence "Right has returned
to its owner" exists, this interpretation of his seems baseless. Rather,
the Prophet's will cannot imply any other will except that for
vicegerency and caliphate, and succession would imply not succession in
property nor in knowledge because this was not an occasion to mention it
here but it must mean the succession in the right leadership which stood
proved as from Allah not only on the ground of kinship but on the ground
of qualities of perfection.
