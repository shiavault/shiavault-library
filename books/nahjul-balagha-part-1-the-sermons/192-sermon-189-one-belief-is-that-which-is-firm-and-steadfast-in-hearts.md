Sermon 189: One belief is that which is firm and steadfast in hearts….

*Steadfast and transient belief and the obligation of migration

One belief is that which is firm and steadfast in hearts, and one is
that which remains temporarily in the heart and the breast up to a
certain time. If you were to acquit (yourself) before any person, you
should wait till death approaches him, for that is the time limit for
being acquitted.

فَمِنَ الاْيمَانِ مَا يَكُونُ ثَابِتاً مُسْتَقِرّاً فِي الْقُلُوبِ،
وَمِنْهُ مَا يَكُونُ عَوَارِىَ بَيْنَ الْقُلُوبِ وَالصُّدورِ، إِلَى
أَجَل مَعْلُوم، فَإِذَا كَانَتْ لَكُمْ بَرَاءَةٌ مِنْ أَحَد فَقِفُوهُ
حَتّى يَحْضُرَهُ الْمَوْتُ، فَعِنْدَ ذَلِكَ يَقَعُ حدُّ الْبَرَاءَةِ.

The obligation of migration
---------------------------

And migration stands as its original position. Allah has no need towards
him who secretly accepts belief or him who openly does so. Migration
will not apply to any one unless he recognises the proof (of Allah) on
the earth. Whoever recognises him and acknowledges him would be a
*muhajir* (migrant). *Istid\`af* (i.e.the state of being deemed weak and
therefore free from the obligation of migration) does not apply to him
to whom the proof (of Allah) reaches and who hears it and his heart
preserves it. [^1]

وَالْهِجْرَةُ قَائِمَةٌ عَلَى حَدِّهَا الاْوَّلِ، مَا كَانَ لله تعالى
فِي أَهْلِ الاْرْضِ حَاجَةٌ مِنْ مُسْتَسِرِّ الاْمَّةِ وَمُعْلِنِهَا،
لاَ يَقَعُ اسْمُ الْهِجْرَةِ عَلَى أَحَد إلاَّ بِمَعْرِفَةِ الْحُجَّةِ
في الاْرْضِ، فَمَنْ عَرَفَهَا وَأَقَرَّ بِهَا فَهُوَ مُهَاجِرٌ، وَلاَ
يَقَعُ اسْمُ الاسْتِضْعَافِ عَلَى مَنْ بَلَغَتْهُ الْحُجَّةُ
فَسَمِعَتْهَا أُذُنُهُ وَوَعَاهَا قَلْبُهُ.

Arduousness of belief

Certainly, our case is difficult and complicated. No one can bear it
except a believer whose heart Allah has tried with belief. Our
traditions will not be preserved except by trustworthy hearts and (men
of) solid understanding.

O people! Ask me before you lose me, because certainly I am acquainted
with the passages of the sky more than the passages of the earth,[^2]
and before that mischief springs upon its feet which would trample even
the nosestring and destroy the wits of the people.

[^1]: This is the interpretation of the word "muhajir" and "mustad\`af"
as mentioned in the Holy Qur'an: Verily those whom the angels take away
(at death) while they are unjust to their (own) selves (in sin), they
(the angels) shall ask (the sinning souls): "In what state were ye?"
They shall reply, "Weakened (mustad\`af - and oppressed) were we in the
land;" They (angels) will say "Was not the land of Allah vast (enough)
for you to immigrate therein?" So these (are those) whose refuge shall
be Hell; and what a bad resort it is. Except the (really) weakened ones
from among the men and the women and the children, who have not in their
power the means (to escape from the unbelievers) and nor do they find
the (right) way. So these, may be, Allah will pardon them; and Allah is
the Clement, the Oft-forgiving. (4:97-99) The meaning of Amir
al-mu'minin here is that hijrah (migration) was not only obligatory
during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet, but it is a permanent
obligation. This migration is even now obligatory for attaining the
proof of Allah and the true religion. Therefore, if one has attained the
proof of Allah and believed in it, even if he is in midst of the
unbelievers of his locality, he is not duty bound to migrate. The
"mustad\`af" (weakened) is one who is living among the unbelievers and
is far from being informed of the proofs of Allah, and at the same time
he is unable to migrate in order to attain the proofs of Allah.

[^2]: Some people have explained this saying of Amir al-mu'minin to mean
that by the passages of the earth he means matters of the world and by
passages of the sky matters of religious law and that Amir al-mu'minin
intends to say that he knows the matters of religious law and
commandments more than the worldly matters. Thus, Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani
writes (in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 4, pp. 200-201): It is related
from al-\`Allamah al-Wabari, that he said that Amir al-mu'minin's
intention is to say that the scope of his religious knowledge is larger
than his knowledge about matters of the world. But taking the context
into account, this explanation cannot be held to be correct because this
sentence (which is the subject of explanation) has been used as the
cause of the sentence "Ask me before you miss me", and after it, is the
prophesy about revolt. In between these two the occurrence of the
sentence that "I know religious matters more than worldly matters",
makes the whole utterance quite uncounted, because Amir al-mu'minin's
challenge to ask whatever one likes is not confined to matters of
religious law only so this sentence could be held as its cause. Then,
after that, the prophesy of the rising up of the revolt has nothing to
do with matters of religious law, so that it could be put forth as a
proof of more knowledge of religious matters. To ignore the clear import
of the words and to interpret them in a way which does not suit the
occasion, does not exhibit a correct spirit, when from the context also
the same meaning accrues which the words openly convey. Thus, it is to
give a warning about the Umayyad's mischief that Amir al-mu'minin
uttered the words: "'Ask me whatever you like'; because I know the paths
and courses of divine destiny more than the passages of the earth. So,
even if you ask me about matters which are recorded in the 'preserved
tablet' and concern divine destiny I can tell you, and a serious
mischief is to rise against me in those matters in which you should have
doubt, because my eyes are more acquainted with those ethereal lines
which concern the occurrence of events and mischiefs than, with what I
know about live appearing on the earth. The occurrence of this mischief
is as certain as an object seen with eyes. You should therefore ask me
its details and the way to keep safe from it, so that you may be able to
manage your defence when the times comes." This meaning is supported by
the successive sayings of Amir al-mu'minin which he uttered in
connection with the unknown, and to which the future testified. Thus,
Ibn Abi'l Hadid comments on this claim of Amir al-mu'minin as follows:
Amir al-mu'minin's claim is also supported by his sayings about future
events which he uttered not once or a hundred times but continuously and
successively, from which there remains no doubt that whatever he spoke
was on the basis of knowledge and certainly and not in the way of
chance. (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 13, p. 106) In connection with this
saying of Amir al-mu'minin it has already been shown and explained (in
Sermon 92, Foot-note No. 2) that no one else dared advance such a claim,
and those who made such a claim had to face only disgrace and humility.
