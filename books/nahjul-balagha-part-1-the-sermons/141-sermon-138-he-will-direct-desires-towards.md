He will direct desires towards (the path of) guidance while people will
have turned guidance towards desires, and he will turn their views to
the direction of the Qur'an while the people will have turned the Qur'an
to their views.

يَعْطِفُ الْهَوَى عَلَى الْهُدَى إِذَا عَطَفُوا الْهُدَى عَلَى
الْهَوَى، وَيَعْطِفُ الرَّأْيَ عَلَى الْقُرْآنِ إِذَا عَطَفُوا
الْقُرْآنَ عَلَى الرَّأْيِ.

(Before this Enjoiner of Good [^1], matters will deteriorate) till war
will rage among you with full force, showing forth its teeth, with
udders full of sweet milk but with a sour tip. Beware, it will be
tomorrow and the morrow will come soon with things which you do not
know. The Man in power, not from this crowd, will take to task all those
were formerly appointed for their ill deeds and the earth will pour
forth its eternal treasures and fling before him easily her keys. He
will show you the just way of behaviour and revive the Qur'an and
*sunnah* which have become lifeless (among people).

As if I see (him), he (the Enjoiner of Evil), [^2] is shouting in Syria
(ash-Sham) and is extending his banners to the outskirts of Kufah. He is
bent towards it like the biting of the she-camel. He has covered the
ground with heads. His mouth is wide open and (the trampling of) his
footsteps on the ground have become heavy. His advance is broad and his
attacks are severe.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كأَنَّي بِهِ قَدْ نَعَقَ بِالشَّامِ، وَفَحَصَ بِرَايَاتِهِ فِي
ضَوَاحِي كُوفَانَ، فَعَطَفَ عَلَيْهَا عَطْفَ الضَّرُوسِ، وَفَرَشَ
الاْرْضَ بِالرُّؤُوسِ، قَدْ فَغَرَتْ فَاغِرَتُهُ، وَثَقُلَتْ فِي
الاْرْضِ وَطْأَتُهُ، بَعِيدَ الْجَوْلَةِ، عَظِيمَ الصَّوْلَةِ.

By Allah, he will disperse you throughout the earth till only a few of
you remain, like kohl in the eye. You will continue like this till the
Arabs return to their senses. You should therefore stick to established
ways, clear signs and the early period which has the lasting virtues of
the Prophethood. You should know that Satan makes his ways easy so that
you may follow him on his heels.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَاللهِ لِيُشَرِّدَنَّكُمْ فِي أَطْرَافِ الاْرْضِ حَتَّى لاَ يَبْقَى
مِنْكُمْ إِلاِّ قَلَيلٌ، كَالْكُحْلِ فِي الْعَيْنِ، فَلاَ تَزَالُونَ
كَذلِكَ، حَتَّى تَؤُوبَ إِلَى الْعَرَبِ عَوَازِبُ أَحْلاَمِهَا!
فَالْزَمُوا السُّنَنَ الْقَائِمَةَ، وَالاْثَارَ الْبَيِّنَةَ،
وَالْعَهْدَ الْقَرِيبَ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ بَاقِي النُّبُوَّةِ.
وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ إِنَّمَا يُسَنِّي لَكُمْ طُرُقَهُ
لِتَتَّبِعُوا عَقِبَهُ.

(1) Al- 'Amidi, *Ghurar,* 296.

[^1]: This prophecy of Amir al-mu'minin is with regard to the appearance
of the Twelfth Imam, Abu'l-Qasim Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Mahdi
(p.b.u.h.).

[^2]: This refers to \`Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who came to power in
Syria (ash-Sham) after his father Marwan ibn al-Hakam and then after the
killing of al-Mukhtar ibn Abi \`Ubayd ath-Thaqafi in his encounter with
Mus\`ab ibn az-Zubayr he proceeded towards Iraq. He clashed with
Mus\`ab's force at Maskin near Dayru'l-jathaliq in the outskirts of
Kufah. After defeating him he made a victorious entry into Kufah and
took allegiance from its inhabitants. Then he sent al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf
ath-Thaqafi to Mecca to fight with \`Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr.
Consequently this man besieged Mecca and stoned it, and shed the blood
of thousands of innocent persons like water. He killed Ibn az-Zubayr and
hung his body on the gallows. He perpetrated such atrocities on the
people that one shudders at the thought of them.
