=======================================

*About the greatness and the attributes of Allah* [^1] *and the
qualities of the Imams*

Praise be to Allah who is proof of His existence through His creation,
of His being eternal through the newness of His creation, and through
their mutual similarities of the fact that nothing is similar to Him.
Senses cannot touch Him and curtains cannot veil Him, because of the
difference between the Maker and the made, the Limiter and the limited
and the Sustainer and the sustained.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
الْحَمْدُ للهِ الدَّالِّ عَلَى وُجُودِهِ بِخَلْقِهِ، وَبِمُحْدَثِ
خَلْقِهِ عَلَى أَزَلِيَّته، وَبِاشْتِبَاهِهِمْ عَلَى أَنْ لاَ شَبَهَ
لَهُ. لاَ تَسْتَلِمُهُ الْمَشَاعِرُ، وَلاَ تَحْجُبُهُ السَّوَاتِرُ،
لاِفْتِرَاِق الصَّانِعِ وَالْمَصْنُوعِ، وَالْحَادِّ وَالْـمَحْدُودِ،
وَالرَّبِّ وَالْمَرْبُوبِ.

He is One but not by the first in counting, is Creator but not through
activity or labour, is Hearer but not by means of any physical organ, is
Looker but not by a stretching of eyelids, is Witness but not by
nearness, is Distinct but not by measurement of distance, is Manifest
but not by seeing and is Hidden but not by subtlety (of body). He is
Distinct from things because He overpowers them and exercises might over
them, while things are distinct from Him because of their subjugation to
Him and their turning towards Him.

الاْحَدُ لاَ بِتَأْوِيلِ عَدَد، وَالْخَالِقُ لاَ بِمَعْنَى حَرَكَة
وَنَصَب، وَالسَّمِيعُ لاَ بِأَدَاة، وَالْبَصِيرُ لاَ بِتَفْرِيقِ آلَة،
وَالشَّاهِدُ لاَبِمُمَاسَّه، وَالْبَائِنُ لاَبِتَرَاخِي مَسَافَة،
وَالظّاهِرُ لاَبِرُؤيَة، وَالْبَاطِنُ لاَ بِلَطَافَة. بَانَ مِنَ
الاْشْيَاءِ بَالْقَهْرِ لَهَا، وَالْقُدْرَةِ عَلَيْهَا، وَبَانَتِ
الاْشْيَاءُ مِنْهُ بَالْخُضُوعِ لَهُ، وَالرُّجُوعِ إِلَيْهِ.

He who describes Him limits Him. He who limits Him numbers Him. He who
numbers Him rejects His eternity. He who said "how" sought a description
for Him. He who said "where" bounded him. He is the Knower even though
there be nothing to be known. He is the Sustainer even though there be
nothing to be sustained. He is the Powerful even though there be nothing
to be overpowered.

مَنْ وَصَفَهُ فَقَدْ حَدَّهُ، وَمَنْ حَدَّهُ فَقَدْ عَدَّهُ، وَمَنْ
عَدَّهُ فَقَدْ أَبْطَلَ أَزَلَهُ، وَمَنْ قَالَ: كَيْفَ، فَقَدِ
اسْتَوْصَفَهُ، وَمَنْ قَالَ: أَيْنَ، فَقَدْ حَيَّزَهُ. عَالِمٌ إِذْ
لاَ مَعْلُومٌ، وَرَبٌّ إِذْ لاَ مَرْبُوبٌ، وَقَادِرٌ إِذْ لاَ
مَقْدُورٌ.

The riser has risen, the sparkler has sparkled, the appearer has
appeared and the curved has been straightened. Allah has replaced one
people with another and one day with another. We awaited these changes
as the famine-stricken await the rain. Certainly the Imams are the
vicegerents of Allah over His creatures and they make the creatures know
Allah. No one will enter Paradise except he who knows them and knows
Him, and no one will enter Hell except he who denies them and denies
Him.

Allah the Glorified, has distinguished you with Islam and has chosen you
for it. This is because it is the name of safety and the collection of
honour. Allah the Glorified, chose its way and disclosed its pleas
through open knowledge and secret maxims. Its (Qur'an) wonders are not
exhausted and its delicacies do not end. It contains blossoming bounties
and lamps of darkness. (The doors of) virtues cannot be opened save with
its keys, nor can gloom be dispelled save with its lamps. Allah has
protected its inaccessible points (from enemies) and allowed grazing (to
its followers) in its pastures. It contains cover (from the ailment of
misguidance) for the seeker of cure and full support for the seeker of
support.

إِنَّ اللهَ خَصَّكُمْ بَالاْسْلاَمِ، وَاسْتَخْلَصَكُمْ لَهُ، وَذلِكَ
لاِنَّهُ اسْمُ سَلاَمَة، وَجِمَاعُ كَرَامَة، اصْطَفَى اللهُ تَعَالَى
مَنْهَجَهُ، وَبَيَّنَ حُجَجَهُ، مِنْ ظَاهِرِ عِلْم، وَبَاطِنِ حِكَم،
لاَ تَفْنَى غَرَائِبُهُ، وَلاَ تَنْقَضِي عَجَائِبُهُ، فِيهِ مَرَابِيعُ
النِّعَمِ، وَمَصَابِيحُ الظُّلَمِ، لاَ تُفْتَحُ الْخَيْرَاتُ إِلاَّ
بِمَفَاتِحِهِ، وَلاَ تُكْشَفُ الظُّلُمَاتُ إِلاَّ بِمَصَابِحِهِ، قَدْ
أَحْمَى حِمَاهُ، وَأَرْعَى مَرْعَاهُ، فِيهِ شِفَاءُ الْمُسْتَشْفِي،
وَكِفَايَةُ الْمُكْتَفِي.

Alternative Sources for Sermon 152
----------------------------------

(1) Al-Kulayni, *Usul al-Kafi,* I, 139;

(2) al-'Amidi, *Ghurar,* 232, 235.

[^1]: The first part of this sermon consists of important issues
concerning the science of knowledge about Allah, wherein Amir
al-mu'minin has thrown light on the matter that Allah is from ever and
His attributes are the same as He Himself. When we cast a glance at
creation, we see that for every movement there is a mover, from which
every man of ordinary wisdom is compelled to conclude that no effect can
appear without a cause, so much so, that even an infant a few days old,
when his body is touched, feels in the depth of his consciousness that
someone has touched him. He indicates it by opening his eyes or turning
and looking. How then can the creation of the world and the system of
all creation be arranged without a Creator or Organiser? Once it is
necessary to believe in a Creator, then He should exist by Himself,
because everything which has a beginning must have a centre of existence
from which it should terminate. If that too needed a creator, there
would be the question of whether this creator is also the creation of
some other creator or exists by itself. Thus unless a Self-created
Creator is believed in, who should be the cause of all causes, the mind
will remain groping in the unending labyrinth of cause and effect, and
never attain the idea of the last extremity of the series of creation.
It would fall into the fallacy of circular arguing and would not reach
any end. If the creator were taken to have created himself, then there
would be (one of the two positions, namely) either he should be
non-existent or existent. If he were not existent, then it would not be
possible for something non-existent to create any existent being. If he
were existent before creating himself, there would be no sense in coming
into being again. Therefore it is necessary to believe that the Creator
should be a Being not dependent on any other creator for His own
existence, and everything else should be dependent on Him. This
dependence of the entire creation is a proof that the existence of the
Source of all creation is from ever and eternal. And since all beings
other than He are subject to change, are dependent on position and place
and are similar to one another in qualities and properties, and since
similarity leads to plurality whereas unity has no like save itself,
therefore nothing can be like Him. Even things called one cannot be
reckoned after His Unity because He is One and Singular in every
respect. He is free and pure from all those attributes which are found
in body or matter because He is neither body, nor colour, nor shape, nor
does He lie in any direction, nor is He bounded within some place or
locality. Therefore, man cannot see or understand Him through his senses
or feelings, because senses can know only those things which accord with
the limitations of time, place and matter. To believe that He can be
seen is to believe that He has body, but since He is not a body, and He
does not exist through a body, and He does not lie in any direction or
place, there is no question of His being seen. But His being unseen is
not like that of subtle material bodies, due to whose delicacy the eye
pierces through them and eyes remain unable to see them; as for example
the wind in the vast firmament. But He is unseen by His very existence.
Nevertheless, nothing is unseen for Him. He sees as well as hears, but
is not dependent on instruments of seeing or hearing, because if He were
in need of organs of the body for hearing and seeing He would be in need
of external things for His perfection and would not be a perfect Being,
whereas He should be perfect in all respects and no attribute of
perfection should be apart from His Self. To believe in attributes
separately from His Self would mean that there would be a self and a few
attributes and the compound of the self and the attributes would be
Allah. But a thing which is compounded is dependent on its parts and
these parts must exist before their composition into the whole. When the
parts exist from before, how can the whole be from ever and eternal
because its existence is later than that of its parts. But Allah had the
attributes of knowledge, power and sustaining even when nothing was
existent, because none of His attributes were created in Him from
outside, but His attributes are His Self and His Self is His attributes.
Consequently, His knowledge does not depend on the object of knowledge
existing first and then His knowledge, because His Self is prior to
things coming into existence. Nor is it necessary for His power that
there should first exist the object to be over-powered and then alone He
would be called Powerful, because Powerful is that who has power equally
for doing or abandoning and as such the existence of the object to be
over-powered is not necessary. Similarly Sustainer means master. Just as
He is the Master of the non-existent after its coming into existence, in
the same way He has power to bring it into existence from non-existence,
namely if He so wills He may bestow existence upon it.
