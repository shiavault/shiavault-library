people (about Talhah and az-Zubayr)*

Beware! Satan[^1] has collected his group and assembled his horse-men
and foot-soldiers. Surely, with me is my sagacity. I have neither
deceived myself nor ever been deceived. By Allah I shall fill to the
brim for them a cistern from which I alone would draw water. They can
neither turn away from it nor return to it.

أَلاَ وإنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ قَدْ جَمَعَ حِزْبَهُ وَاسْتَجْلَبَ خَيْلَهُ
وَرَجِلَهُ، وإِنَّ مَعِي لَبَصِيرَتي. مَا لَبَّسْتُ عَلَى نَفْسِي،
وَلاَ لُبِّسَ عَلَيَّ. وَايْمُ اللهِ لاَفْرِطَنَّ لَهُمْ حَوْضاً أَنَا
مَاتِحُهُ !لاَ يَصْدِرُونَ عَنْهُ، وَلاَ يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ.

(1) Al-Mufid, *al-'Irshad,* 118; see also under Sermon:22 and Sermon:134
below.

[^1]: When Talhah and az-Zubayr broke away by violating the Oath of
allegiance and set for Basrah in the company of \`A'ishah, Amir
al-mu'minin spoke in these words which are part of the long speech. Ibn
Abi'l-Hadid has written that in this sermon Satan denotes the real Satan
as well as Mu\`awiyah because Mu\`awiyah was secretly conspiring with
Talhah and az-Zubayr and instigating them to fight against Amir
al-mu'minin but the reference to the real Satan is more appropriate,
obvious and in accord with the situation and circumstances.
