Sermon 3: By Allah, the son of Abu Quhafah….
============================================

*Known as the Sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyah*[^1]

Beware! By Allah, the son of Abu Quhafah (Abu Bakr)[^2] dressed himself
with it (the caliphate) and he certainly knew that my position in
relation to it was the same as the position of the axis in relation to
the hand-mill. The flood water flows down from me and the bird cannot
fly upto me. I put a curtain against the caliphate and kept myself
detached from it.

Then I began to think whether I should assault or endure calmly the
blinding darkness of tribulations wherein the grown up are made feeble
and the young grow old and the true believer acts under strain till he
meets Allah (on his death).

Proposes Patience in Absence of Supporters
------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">

I found that endurance thereon was wiser. So I adopted patience although
there was pricking in the eye and suffocation (of mortification) in the
throat. I watched the plundering of my inheritance till the first one
went his way but handed over the Caliphate to Ibn al-Khattab after
himself.

(Then he quoted al-A\`sha’s verse):

*My days are now passed on the camel’s back (in difficulty) while there
were days (of ease) when I enjoyed the company of Jabir’s brother
Hayyan.*[^3]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَرَأَيْتُ أَنَّ الصَّبْرَ عَلَى هَاتَا أَحْجَى، فَصَبَرتُ وَفي
الْعَيْنِ قَذىً، وَفي الحَلْقِ شَجاً، أرى تُرَاثي نَهْباً، حَتَّى
مَضَى الاْوَّلُ لِسَبِيلِهِ، فَأَدْلَى بِهَا إِلَى ابْنِ الْخَطّابِ
بَعْدَهُ. ( ثم تمثل بقول الاعشى):

It is strange that during his lifetime he wished to be released from the
caliphate but he confirmed it for the other one after his death. No
doubt these two shared its udders strictly among themselves. This one
put the Caliphate in a tough enclosure where the utterance was haughty
and the touch was rough. Mistakes were in plenty and so also the excuses
therefore. One in contact with it was like the rider of an unruly camel.
If he pulled up its rein the very nostril would be slit, but if he let
it loose he would be thrown. Consequently, by Allah people got involved
in recklessness, wickedness, unsteadiness and deviation.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَيَا عَجَباً!! بَيْنَا هُوَ يَسْتَقِيلُها في حَيَاتِهِ إِذْ عَقَدَهَا
لاخَرَ بَعْدَ وَفَاتِهِ ـ لَشَدَّ مَا تَشَطَّرَا ضَرْعَيْهَا ! ـ
فَصَيَّرَهَا في حَوْزَة خَشْنَاءَ، يَغْلُظُ كَلْمُهَا، وَيَخْشُنُ
مَسُّهَا، وَيَكْثُرُ العِثَارُ فِيهَا وَالاْعْتَذَارُ مِنْهَا،
فَصَاحِبُهَا كَرَاكِبِ الصَّعْبَةِ، إِنْ أَشْنَقَ لَهَا خَرَمَ، وَإِنْ
أَسْلَسَ لَهَا تَقَحَّمَ، فَمُنِيَ النَّاسُ ـ لَعَمْرُ اللهِ ـ بِخَبْط
وَشِمَاس، وَتَلَوُّن وَاعْتِرَاض.
  </p>

Nevertheless, I remained patient despite length of period and stiffness
of trial, till when he went his way (of death) he put the matter (of
Caliphate) in a group[^4] and regarded me to be one of them. But good
Heavens! What had I to do with this “consultation”? Where was any doubt
about me with regard to the first of them that I was now considered akin
to these ones? But I remained low when they were low and flew high when
they flew high.

One of them turned against me because of his hatred and the other got
inclined the other way due to his in-law relationship and this thing and
that thing, till the third man of these people stood up with heaving
breasts between his dung and fodder. With him his children of his
grand-father, (Umayyah) also stood up swallowing up Allah’s wealth[^5]
like a camel devouring the foliage of spring, till his rope broke down,
his actions finished him and his gluttony brought him down prostrate.

At that moment, nothing took me by surprise, but the crowd of people
rushing to me. It advanced towards me from every side like the mane of
the hyena so much so that Hasan and Husayn were getting crushed and both
the ends of my shoulder garment were torn. They collected around me like
a herd of sheep and goats. When I took up the reins of government one
party broke away and another turned disobedient while the rest began
acting wrongfully as if they had not heard the word of Allah saying:

***That abode in the hereafter, We assign it for those who intend not to
exult themselves in the earth, nor (to make) mischief (therein); and the
end is (best) for the pious ones. (Qur’an, 28:83)***

Yes, by Allah, they had heard it and understood it but the world
appeared glittering in their eyes and its embellishments seduced them.
Behold, by Him who split the grain (to grow) and created living beings,
if people had not come to me and supporters had not exhausted the
argument and if there had been no pledge of Allah with the learned to
the effect that they should not acquiesce in the gluttony of the
oppressor and the hunger of the oppressed I would have cast the rope of
Caliphate on its own shoulders, and would have given the last one the
same treatment as to the first one. Then you would have seen that in my
view this world of yours is no better than the sneezing of a goat.

(It is said that when Amir al-mu’minin reached here in his sermon a man
of Iraq stood up and handed him over a writing. Amir al-mu’minin began
looking at it, when Ibn \`Abbas said, “O’ Amir al-mu’minin, I wish you
resumed your Sermon from where you broke it.” Thereupon he replied, “O’
Ibn \`Abbas it was like the foam of a Camel which gushed out but
subsided.” Ibn \`Abbas says that he never grieved over any utterance as
he did over this one because Amir al-mu’minin could not finish it as he
wished to.)

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قالوا: وقام إِليه رجل من أهل السوادعند بلوغه إلى هذا الموضع من خطبته،
فناوله كتاباً، فأقبل ينظر فيه، فلمّا فرغ من قراءته قال له ابن عباس: يا

السلام): هَيْهَاتَ يَابْنَ عَبَّاس! تِلْكَ شِقْشِقَةٌ هَدَرَتْ ثُمَّ
قَرَّتْ! قال ابن عباس: فوالله ما أَسفت على كلام قطّ كأَسفي على ذلك
الكلام أَلاَّ يكون أميرالمؤمنين (عليه السلام) بلغ منه حيث أراد.

</blockquote>

**Al-Sharif al-Radi says:** The words in this sermon “like the rider of
a camel” mean to convey that when a camel rider is stiff in drawing up
the rein then in this scuffle the nostril gets bruised, but if he lets
it loose in spite of the camel’s unruliness, it would throw him
somewhere and would get out of control. *“ashnaq an-naqah”* is used when
the rider holds up the rein and raises the camel’s head upwards. In the
same sense the word *“shanaqa an-naqah”* is used. Ibn as-Sikkit has
mentioned this in *Islah al-Mantiq*.

Amir al-mu’minin has said *“ashnaqa laha”* instead of *“ashnaqaha”*,
this is because he has used this word in harmony with *“aslasa laha”*
and harmony could be retained only by using both in the same form. Thus,
Amir al-mu’minin has used *“ashnaqa laha”* as though in place of *“in
rafa\`a laha ra’saha”*, that is, “if he stops it by holding up the
reins.”

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال الشريف الرضي: قوله (عليه السلام) في هذه الخطبة: «كراكب الصعبة إن
أشنق لها خرم، وإن أسلس لها تقحم» يريد: أنه إذا شدد عليها في جذب الزمام
وهي تنازعه رأسها خرم أنفها، وإن أرخى لها شيئاً مع صعوبتها تقحمت به فلم
يملكها، يقال: أشنق الناقة، إذا جذب رأسها بالزمام فرفعه، وشنقها أيضاً:
ذكر ذلك ابن السكيت في «إصلاح المنطق». وإنما قال (عليه السلام): «أشنق
لها» ولم يقل: «أشنقها»، لانه جعله في مقابلة قوله: «أسلس لها»، فكأنه
(عليه السلام) قال: إن رفع لها رأسها يعني أمسكه عليها بالزمام .

[^1]: This sermon is known as the sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyyah, and is
counted among the most famous sermons of Amir al-mu'minin. It was
delivered at ar-Rahbah. Although some people have denied it to be Amir
al-mu'minin's utterance and by attributing it to as-Sayyid ar-Radi (or
ash-Sharif ar-Radi) have laid blame on his acknowledged integrity, yet
truth-loving scholars have denied its veracity. Nor can there be any
ground for this denial because \`Ali's (p.b.u.h.) difference of view in
the matter of Caliphate is not a secret matter, so that such hints
should be regarded as something alien. And the events which have been
alluded to in this sermon are preserved in the annals of history which
testifies them word by word and sentence by sentence. If the same events
which are related by history are recounted by Amir al-mu'minin then what
is the ground for denying them? If the memory of discouraging
circumstances faced by him soon after the death of the Prophet appeared
unpalatable to him it should not be surprising. No doubt this sermon
hits at the prestige of certain personalities and gives a set back to
the faith and belief in them but this cannot be sustained by denying the
sermon to be Amir al-mu'minin's utterance, unless the true events are
analysed and truth unveiled; otherwise just denying it to be Amir
al-mu'minin's utterance because it contains disparagement of certain
individuals carries no weight, when similar criticism has been related
by other historians as well. Thus (Abu \`Uthman) \`Amr ibn Bahr al-Jahiz
has recorded the following words of a sermon of Amir al-mu'minin and
they are not less weighty than the criticism in the "Sermon of
ash-Shiqshiqiyyah." Those two passed away and the third one rose like
the crow whose courage is confined to the belly. It would have been
better if both his wings had been cut and his head severed.
Consequently, the idea that it is the production of as-Sayyid ar-Radi is
far from truth and a result of partisanship and partiality. Or else if
it is the result of some research it should be brought out. Otherwise,
remaining in such wishful illusion does not alter the truth, nor can the
force of decisive arguments be curbed down by mere disagreement and
displeasure. Now we set forth the evidence of those scholars and
traditionists who have clearly held it to be Amir al-mu'minin's
production, so that its historical importance should become known. Among
these scholars some are those before as-Sayyid ar-Radi's period, some
are his contemporaries and some are those who came after him but they
all related it through their own chain of authority. 1) Ibn Abi'l-Hadid
al-Mu\`tazili writes that his master Abu'l-Khayr Musaddiq ibn Shabib
al-Wasiti (d. 605 A.H.) stated that he heard this sermon from ash-Shaykh
Abu Muhammad \`Abdullah ibn Ahmad al-Baghdadi (d. 567 A.H.) known as Ibn
al-Khashshab and when he reached where Ibn \`Abbas expressed sorrow for
this sermon having remained incomplete Ibn al-Khashshab said to him that
if he had heard the expression of sorrow from Ibn \`Abbas he would have
certainly asked him if there had remained with his cousin any further
unsatisfied desire because excepting the Prophet he had already spared
neither the predecessors nor followers and had uttered all that he
wished to utter. Why should therefore be any sorrow that he could not
say what he wished? Musaddiq says that Ibn al-Khashshab was a man of
jolly heart and decent taste. I inquired from him whether he also
regarded the sermon to be a fabrication when he replied "By Allah, I
believe it to be Amir al-mu'minin's word as I believe you to be Musaddiq
ibn Shabib." I said that some people regard it to be as-Sayyid ar-Radi's
production when he replied: "How can ar-Radi have such guts or such
style of writing. I have seen as-Sayyid ar-Radi's writings and know his
style of composition. Nowhere does his writing match with this one and I
have already seen it in books written two hundred years before the birth
of as-Sayyid ar-Radi, and I have seen it in familiar writings about
which I know by which scholars or men of letters they were compiled. At
that time not only ar-Radi but even his father Abu Ahmad an-Naqib has
not been born." 2) Thereafter Ibn Abi'l-Hadid writes that he saw this
sermon in the compilations of his master Abu'l-Qasim (\`Abdullah ibn
Ahmad) al-Balkhi (d. 317 A.H.). He was the Imam of the Mu'tazilites in
the reign of al-Muqtadir Billah while al-Muqtadir's period was far
earlier than the birth of as-Sayyid ar-Radi. 3) He further writes that
he saw this sermon in Abu Ja\`far (Muhammad ibn \`Abd ar-Rahman), Ibn
Qibah's book al-Insaf. He was the pupil of Abu'l-Qasim al-Balkhi and a
theologian of Imamiyyah (Shi\`ite) sect. (Sharh of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid,
vol.1, pp.205-206) 4) Ibn Maytham al-Bahrani (d. 679 A.H.) writes in his
commentary that he had seen one such copy of this sermon which bore
writing of al-Muqtadir Billah's minister Abu'l-Hasan \`Ali ibn Muhammad
ibn al-Furat (d. 312 A.H.). (Sharh al-balaghah, vol.1., pp.252-253) 5)
al-\`Allamah Muhammad Baqir al-Majlisi has related the following chain
of authority about this Sermon from ash-Shaykh Qutbu'd-Din ar-Rawandi's
compilation Minhaj al-bara\`ah fi Sharh Nahjul Balaghah: Ash-Shaykh Abu
Nasr al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim informed me from al-Hajib
Abu'l-Wafa' Muhammad ibn Badi\`, al-Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn Badi\` and
al-Husayn ibn Ahmad ibn \`Abd ar-Rahman and they from al-Hafiz Abu Bakr
(Ahmad ibn Musa) ibn Marduwayh al-Isbahani (d. 416 A.H.) and he from
al-Hafiz Abu'l-Qasim Sulayman ibn Ahmad at-Tabarani (d. 360 A.H.) and he
from Ahmad ibn \`Ali al-Abbar and he from Is'haq ibn Sa\`id Abu Salamah
ad-Dimashqi and he from Khulayd ibn Da\`laj and he from \`Ata' ibn Abi
Rabah and he from Ibn \`Abbas. (Bihar al-anwar, 1st ed. vol.8,
pp.160-161) 6) In the context al-\`Allamah al-Majlisi has written that
this sermon is also contained in the compilations of Abu \`Ali (Muhammad
ibn \`Abd al-Wahhab) al-Jubba 'i (d. 303 A.H.) . 7) In connection with
this very authenticity al-\`Allamah al-Majlisi writes: Al-Qadi \`Abd
al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad al-Asad'abadi (d. 415A.H.) who was a strict
Mu\`tazilite explains some expressions of this sermon in his book
al-Mughni and tries to prove that it does not strike against any
preceding caliph but does not deny it to be Amir al-mu'minin's
composition. (ibid., p.161) 8) Abu Ja\`far Muhammad ibn \`Ali, Ibn
Babawayh (d. 381 A.H.) writes: Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Is'haq
at-Talaqani told us that \`Abd al-\`Aziz ibn Yahya al-Jaludi (d. 332
A.H.) told him that Abu \`Abdillah Ahmad ibn \`Ammar ibn Khalid told him
that Yahya ibn \`Abd al-Hamid al- Himmani (d. 228 A.H.) told him that
\`Isa ibn Rashid related this sermon from \`Ali ibn Hudhayfah and he
from \`Ikrimah and he from Ibn \`Abbas. (\`Ilal ash-shara'i\`,vol.1,
chap. 122, p.144; Ma\`ani al-akhbar, chap.22, pp.360-361) 9) Then Ibn
Babawayh records the following chain of authorities :- Muhammad ibn
\`Ali Majilawayh related this sermon to us and he took it from his uncle
Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Qasim and he from Ahmad ibn Abi \`Abdillah (Muhammad
ibn Khalid) al-Barqi and he from his father and he from (Muhammad) Ibn
Abi \`Umayr and he from Aban ibn \`Uthman and he from Aban ibn Taghlib
and he from \`Ikrimah and he from Ibn \`Abbas. (\`Ilal ash-shara'i\`,
vol.1, chap.122, p.l46; Ma\`ani al-akhbar, chap.22, p.361) 10) Abu Ahmad
al-Hasan ibn \`Abdillah ibn Sa\`id al-\`Askari (d.382 A.H.) who counts
among great scholars of the Sunnis has written commentary and
explanation of this sermon that has been recorded by Ibn Babawayh in
\`Ilal ash-shara'i\` and Ma\`ani al-akhbar. 11) as-Sayyid Ni\`matullah
al-Jaza'iri writes: The author of Kitab al-gharat Abu Is'haq, Ibrahim
ibn Muhammad ath-Thaqafi al-Kufi (d. 283 A.H.) has related this sermon
through his own chain of authorities. The date of completion of writing
this book is Tuesday the 13th Shawwal 255 A.H. and in the same year,
Murtada al-Musawi was born. He was older in age than his brother
as-Sayyid ar-Radi. (Anwar an-Nu\`maniyyah, p.37) 12) as-Sayyid Radi
ad-Din Abu'l-Qasim \`Ali ibn Musa, Ibn Tawus al-Husayni al-Hulli (d. 664
A.H.) has related this sermon from Kitab al-gharat with the following
chain of authorities:- This sermon was related to us by Muhammad ibn
Yusuf who related it from al-Hasan ibn \`Ali ibn \`Abd al-Karim
az-Za\`farani and he from Muhammad ibn Zakariyyah al-Ghallabi and he
from Ya\`qub ibn Ja\`far ibn Sulayman and he from his father and he from
his grand-father and he from Ibn \`Abbas. (Translation of at-Tara'if,
p.202) 13) Shaykh at-Ta'ifah, Muhammad ibn al- Hasan at-Tusi (d. 460
A.H.) writes: (Abu'l-Fath Hilal ibn Muhammad ibn Ja\`far) al-Haffar
related this sermon to us. He related it from Abu'l-Qasim (Isma\`il ibn
\`Ali ibn \`Ali) ad-Di\`bili and he from his father and he from his
brother Di\`bil (ibn \`Ali al-Kuza\`i) and he from Muhammad ibn Salamah
ash-Shami and he from Zurarah ibn A\`yan and he from Abu Ja\`far
Muhammad ibn \`Ali and he from Ibn \`Abbas. (al-Amali, p.237) 14)
ash-Shaykh al-Mufid (Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn an-Nu\`man, d. 413 A.H.)
who was the teacher of as-Sayyid ar-Radi writes about the chain of
authorities of this sermon: A number of relaters of traditions have
related this sermon from Ibn \`Abbas through numerous chains.
(al-Irshad, p.135) 15) \`Alam al-Huda (emblem of guidance) as-Sayyid
al-Murtada who was the elder brother of as-Sayyid ar-Radi has recorded
it on pp. 203,204 of his book ash-Shafi. 16) Abu Mansur at-Tabarsi
writes: A number of relaters have given an account of this sermon from
Ibn \`Abbas through various chains. Ibn \`Abbas said that he was in the
audience of Amir al-mu'minin at ar-Rahbah (a place in Kufah) when
conversation turned to Caliphate and those who had preceded him as
Caliphs, when Amir al-mu'minin breathed a sigh and delivered this
sermon. (al-Ihtijaj, p. 101) 17) Abu'l-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn \`Abdillah and
Sibt ibn al-Jawzi al-Hanafi (d. 654 A.H.) writes: Our ash-Shaykh
Abu'l-Qasim an-Nafis al-Anbari related this sermon to us through his
chain of authorities that ends with Ibn \`Abbas, who said that after
allegiance had been paid to Amir al-mu'minin as Caliph he was sitting on
the pulpit when a man from the audience enquired why he had remained
quiet till then whereupon Amir al-mu'minin delivered this sermon
extempore. (Tadhkarat khawass al-ummah, p.73) 18) al-Qadi Ahmad ibn
Muhammad, ash-Shihab al-Khafaji (d. 1069 A.H.) writes with regard to its
authenticity: It is stated in the utterances of Amir al-mu'minin \`Ali
(Allah may be pleased with him) that "It is strange during life time he
(Abu Bakr) wanted to give up the Caliphate but he strengthened its
foundation for the other one after his death." (Sharh durrat al-ghawwas,
p.17) 19) ash-Shaykh \`Ala ad-Dawlah as-Simnani writes: Amir al-mu'minin
Sayyid al-\`Arifin \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) has stated in one of his brilliant
Sermons "this is the Shiqshiqah that burst forth." (al-\`Urwah li ahl
al-khalwah wa'l-jalwah, p3, manuscript in Nasiriah Library, Lucknow,
India) 20) Abu'l-Fadl Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Maydani (d. 518 A.H.) has
written in connection with the word Shiqshiqah: One sermon of Amir
al-mu'minin \`Ali is known as Khutbah ash-Shiqshiqiyyah (the sermon of
the Camel's Foam). (Majma\` al-amthal, vol.1, p.369) 21) In fifteen
places in an-Nihayah while explaining the words of this sermon
Abu's-Sa\`adat Mubarak ibn Muhammad, Ibn al-Athir al-Jazari (d. 606
A.H.) has acknowledged it to be Amir al-mu'minin's utterance. 22) Shaykh
Muhammad Tahir Patni while explaining the same words in Majma\` bihar
al-anwar testifies this sermon to be Amir al-mu'minin's by saying,
"\`Ali says so." 23) Abu'l-Fadl ibn Manzur (d. 711 A.H.) has
acknowledged it as Amir al-mu'minin's utterance in Lisan al-\`Arab,
vol.12, p.54 by saying, "In the sayings of \`Ali in his sermon 'It is
the camel's foam that burst forth then subsided.'" 24) Majdu'd-Din
al-Firuz'abadi (d. 816/817 A.H.) has recorded under the word
"Shiqshiqah" in his lexicon (al-Qamus, vol.3, p.251): Khutbah
ash-Shiqshiqiyyah is by \`Ali so named because when Ibn \`Abbas asked
him to resume it where he had left it, he said "O' Ibn \`Abbas! it was
the foam of a camel that burst forth then subsided." 25) The compiler of
Muntaha al-adab writes: Khutbah ash-Shiqshiqiyyah of \`Ali is attributed
to \`Ali (Allah may honour his face). 26) ash-Shaykh Muhammad \`Abduh,
Mufti of Egypt, recognising it as Amir al-mu'minin's utterance, has
written its explanations. 27) Muhammad Muhyi'd-Din \`Abd al-Hamid,
Professor in the Faculty of Arabic Language, al-Azhar University has
written annotations on Nahjul Balaghah adding a foreword in the
beginning wherein he recognises all such sermons which contain
disparaging remarks to be the utterances of Amir al-mu'minin. In the
face of these evidences and undeniable proofs is there any scope to hold
that it is not Amir al-mu'minin's production and that as-Sayyid ar-Radi
prepared it himself?

[^2]: Amir al-mu'minin has referred to Abu Bakr's accession to the
Caliphate metaphorically as having dressed himself with it. This was a
common metaphor. Thus, when \`Uthman was called to give up the Caliphate
he replied, "I shall not put off this shirt which Allah has put on me."
No doubt Amir al-mu'minin has not attributed this dressing of Caliphate
to Allah but to Abu Bakr himself because according to unanimous opinion
his Caliphate was not from Allah but his own affair. That is why Amir
al-mu'minin said that Abu Bakr dressed himself with the Caliphate. He
knew that this dress had been stitched for his own body and his position
with relation to the Caliphate was that of the axis in the hand-mill
which cannot retain its central position without it nor be of any use.
Similarly, he held "I was the central pivot of the Caliphate, were I not
there, its entire system would have gone astray from the pivot. It was I
who acted as a guard for its organisation and order and guided it
through all difficulties. Currents of learning flowed from my bosom and
watered it on all sides. My position was high beyond imagination but
lust of world seekers for government became a tumbling stone for me and
I had to confine myself to seclusion. Blinding darkness prevailed all
round and there was intense gloom everywhere. The young grew old and the
old departed for the graves but this patience-breaking period would not
end. I kept watching with my eyes the plundering of my own inheritance
and saw the passing of Caliphate from one hand to the other but remained
patient as I could not stop their high-handedness for lack of means."
Need For The Prophet's Caliph And The Mode Of His Appointment After the
Prophet of Islam the presence of such a personality was inevitable who
could stop the community from disintegration and guard the religious law
against change, alteration and interference by those who wanted to twist
it to suit their own desires. If this very need is denied then there is
no sense in attaching so much importance to the succession of the
Prophet that the assemblage in Saqifah of Banu Sa\`idah should have been
considered more important than the burial of the Prophet. If the need is
recognised, the question is whether or not the Prophet too realised it.
If it is held he could not attend to it and appreciate its need or
absence of need it would be the biggest proof for regarding the
Prophet's mind to be blank for thinking of means to stop the evils of
innovations and apostasy in spite of having given warnings about them.
If it is said that he did realise it but had to live it unresolved on
account of some advantage then instead of keeping it hidden the
advantage should be clearly indicated otherwise silence without purpose
would constitute delinquency in the discharge of the obligations of
Prophethood. If there was some impediment, it should be disclosed
otherwise we should agree that just as the Prophet did not leave any
item of religion incomplete he did not leave this matter either and did
propose such a course of action for it, that if it was acted upon
religion would have remained safe against the interference of others.
The question now is what was that course of action. If it is taken to be
the consensus of opinion of the community then it cannot truly take
place as in such consensus acquiescence of every individual is
necessary; but taking into account the difference in human temperaments
it seems impossible that they would agree on any single point. Nor is
there any example where on such matters there has been no single voice
of dissent. How then can such a fundamental need be made dependent on
the occurrence of such an impossible event - need on which converges the
future of Islam and the good of the Muslims. Therefore, the mind is not
prepared to accept this criterion. Nor is tradition in harmony with it,
as al-Qadi \`Adud ad-Din al-'Iji has written in Sharh al-mawaqif: ‘You
should know that Caliphate cannot depend upon unanimity of election
because no logical or traditional argument can be advanced for it’. In
fact when the advocates of unanimous election found that unanimity of
all votes is difficult they adopted the agreement of the majority as a
substitute for unanimity, ignoring the difference of the minority. In
such a case also it often happens that the force of fair and foul or
correct and incorrect ways turns the flow of the majority opinion in the
direction where there is neither individual distinction nor personal
merit as a result of which competent persons remain hidden while
incompetent individuals stand forward. When capabilities remain so
curbed and personal ends stand in the way as hurdles, how can there be
expectation for the election of correct person. Even if it is assumed
that all voters have an independent unbiased view, that none of them has
his own objective and that none has any other consideration, it is not
necessary that every verdict of the majority should be correct, and that
it cannot go astray. Experience shows that after experiment the majority
has held its own verdict to be wrong. If every verdict of the majority
is correct then its first verdict should be wrong because the verdict
which holds it wrong is also that of the majority. In this circumstances
if the election of the Caliph goes wrong who would be responsible for
the mistake, and who should face the blame for the ruination of the
Islamic polity. Similarly on whom would be the liability for the
bloodshed and slaughter following the turmoil and activity of the
elections. When it has been seen that even those who sat in the audience
of the Holy Prophet could not be free of mutual quarrel and strife how
can others avoid it. If with a view to avoid mischief it is left to the
people of authority to choose anyone they like then here too the same
friction and conflict would prevail because here again convergence of
human temperaments on one point is not necessary nor can they be assumed
to rise above personal ends. In fact here the chances of conflict and
collision would be stronger because if not all at least most of them
would themselves be candidates for that position and would not spare any
effort to defeat their opponent, creating impediments in his way as best
as possible. Its inevitable consequence would be mutual struggle and
mischief-mongering. Thus, it would not be possible to ward off the
mischief for which this device was adopted, and instead of finding a
proper individual the community would just become an instrument for the
achievement of personal benefits of the others. Again, what would be the
criterion for these people in authority? The same as has usually been,
namely whoever collects a few supporters and is able to create commotion
in any meeting by use of forceful words would count among the people of
authority. Or would capabilities also be judged? If the mode of judging
the capabilities is again this very common vote then the same
complications and conflicts would arise here too, to avoid which this
way was adopted. If there is some other standard, then instead of
judging the capabilities of the voters by it why not judge the person
who is considered suitable for the position in view. Further, how many
persons in authority would be enough to give a verdict? Apparently a
verdict once accepted would be precedent for good and the number that
would give this verdict would become the criterion for future. al-Qadi
\`Adud ad-Din al-'Iji writes: ‘Rather the nomination of one or two
individuals by the people in authority is enough because we know that
the companions who were strict in religion deemed it enough as the
nomination of Abu Bakr by \`Umar and of \`Uthman by \`Abd ar-Rahman’.
(Sharh al-mawaqif, p.351 ) This is the account of the "unanimous
election" in the Hall of Bani Sa\`idah and the activity of the
consultative assembly: that is, one man's action has been given the name
of unanimous election and one individual's deed given the name of
consultative assembly. Abu Bakr had well understood this reality that
election means the vote of a person or two only which is to be
attributed to common simple people. That is why he ignored the
requirements of unanimous election, majority vote or method of choosing
through electoral assembly and appointed \`Umar by nomination. \`A'ishah
also considered that leaving the question of caliphate to the vote of a
few particular individuals meant inviting mischief and trouble. She sent
a word to \`Umar on his death saying: Do not leave the Islamic community
without a chief. Nominate a Caliph for it and leave it not without an
authority as otherwise I apprehend mischief and trouble. When the
election by those in authority proved futile it was given up and only
"might is right" became the criteria-namely whoever subdues others and
binds them under his sway and control is accepted as the Caliph of the
Prophet and his true successor. These are those self-adopted principles
in the face of which all the Prophet's sayings uttered in the "Feast of
the Relatives," on the night of hijrah, at the battle of Tabuk, on the
occasion of conveying the Qur'anic chapter "al-Bara'ah" (at-Tawbah,
chap.9) and at Ghadir (the spring of) Khumm. The strange thing is that
when each of the first three caliphates is based on one individual's
choice how can this very right to choose be denied to the Prophet
himself, particularly when this was the only way to end all the
dissension, namely that the Prophet should have himself settled it and
saved the community from future disturbances and spared it from leaving
this decision in the hands of people who were themselves involved in
personal aims and objects. This is the correct procedure which stands to
reason and which has also the support of the Prophet's definite sayings.

[^3]: Hayyan ibn as-Samin al-Hanafi of Yamamah was the chief of the
tribe Banu Hanifah and the master of fort and army. Jabir is the name of
his younger brother while al-A\`sha whose real name was Maymun ibn Qays
ibn Jandal enjoyed the position of being his bosom friend and led a
decent happy life through his bounty. In this verse he has compared his
current life with the previous one that is the days when he roamed about
in search of livelihood and those when he led a happy life in Hayyan's
company. Generally Amir al-mu'minin's quoting of this verse has been
taken to compare this troubled period with the peaceful days passed
under the care and protection of the Prophet when he was free from all
sorts of troubles and enjoyed mental peace. But taking into account the
occasion for making this comparison and the subject matter of the verse
it would not be far fetched if it is taken to indicate the difference
between the unimportant position of those in power during the Prophet's
life time and the authority and power enjoyed by them after him, that
is, at one time in the days of the Prophet no heed was paid to them
because of \`Ali's personality but now the time had so changed that the
same people were masters of the affairs of the Muslim world.

[^4]: When \`Umar was wounded by Abu Lu'lu'ah and he saw that it was
difficult for him to survive because of the deep wound, he formed a
consultative committee and nominated for it \`Ali ibn Abi Talib,
\`Uthman ibn \`Affan, \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf, az-Zubayr ibn
al-\`Awwam, Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas, and Talhah ibn \`Ubaydillah and bound
them that after three days of his death they should select one of
themselves as the Caliph while for those three days Suhayb should act as
Caliph. On receipt of these instructions some members of the committee
requested him to indicate what ideas he had about each of them to enable
them to proceed further in their light. \`Umar therefore disclosed his
own view about each individual. He said that Sa\`d was harsh-tempered
and hot headed; \`Abd ar-Rahman was the Pharaoh of the community;
az-Zubayr was, if pleased, a true believer but if displeased an
unbeliever; Talhah was the embodiment of pride and haughtiness, if he
was made caliph he would put the ring of the caliphate on his wife's
finger while \`Uthman did not see beyond his kinsmen. As regards \`Ali
he is enamoured of the Caliphate although I know that he alone can run
it on right lines. Nevertheless, despite this admission, he thought it
necessary to constitute the consultative Committee and in selecting its
members and laying down the working procedure he made sure that the
Caliphate would take the direction in which he wished to turn it. Thus,
a man of ordinary prudence can draw the conclusion that all the factors
for \`Uthman's success were present therein. If we look at its members
we see that one of them namely \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf is the husband
of \`Uthman's sister, next Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas besides bearing malice
towards \`Ali is a relation and kinsman of \`Abd ar-Rahman. Neither of
them can be taken to go against \`Uthman. The third Talhah ibn
\`Ubaydillah about whom Prof. Muhammad \`Abduh writes in his annotation
on Nahjul Balaghah: Talhah was inclined towards \`Uthman and the reason
for it was no less than that he was against \`Ali, because he himself
was at at-Taymi and Abu Bakr's accession to the Caliphate had created
bad blood between Bani Taym and Banu Hashim. As regards az-Zubayr, even
if he had voted for \`Ali, what could his single vote achieve. According
to at-Tabari's statement Talhah was not present in Medina at that time
but his absence did not stand in the way of \`Uthman's success. Rather
even if he were present, as he did actually reach at the meeting (of the
Committee), and he is taken to be \`Ali's supporter, still there could
be no doubt in \`Uthman's success because \`Umar's sagacious mind had
set the working procedure that: If two agree about one and the other two
about another then \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar should act as the arbitrator.
The group whom he orders should choose the Caliph from among themselves.
If they do not accept \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar's verdict, support should be
given to the group which includes \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf, but if the
others do not agree they should be beheaded for opposing this verdict.
(at-Tabari, vol.1, pp.2779-2780; Ibn al-Athir, vol.3, p.67). Here
disagreement with the verdict of \`Abdullah ibn \`Umar has no meaning
since he was directed to support the group which included \`Abd
ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf. He had ordered his son \`Abdullah and Suhayb that:
‘If the people differ, you should side with the majority, but if three
of them are on one side and the other three on the other, you should
side with the group including \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf’. (at-Tabari,
vol.1, pp.2725,2780; Ibn al-Athir, vol.3, pp.51,67). In this instruction
the agreement with the majority also means support of \`Abd ar-Rahman
because the majority could not be on any other side since fifty
blood-thirsty swords had been put on the heads of the opposition group
with orders to fall on their heads on \`Abd ar-Rahman's behest. Amir
al-mu'minin's eye had fore-read it at that very moment that the
Caliphate was going to \`Uthman as appears from his following words
which he spoke to al-\`Abbas ibn \`Abd al-Muttalib: "The Caliphate has
been turned away from us." al-\`Abbas asked how could he know it. Then
he replied, "\`Uthman has also been coupled with me and it has been laid
down that the majority should be supported; but if two agree on one and
two on the other, then support should be given to the group which
includes \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn \`Awf. Now Sa\`d will support his cousin
\`Abd ar-Rahman who is of course the husband of \`Uthman's sister."
(ibid ) However, after \`Umar's death this meeting took place in the
room of \`A'ishah and on its door stood Abu Talhah al-Ansari with fifty
men having drawn swords in their hands. Talhah started the proceedings
and inviting all others to be witness said that he gave his right of
vote to \`Uthman. This touched az-Zubayr's sense of honour as his mother
Safiyyah daughter of \`Abd al-Muttalib was the sister of Prophet's
father. So he gave his right of vote to \`Ali. Thereafter Sa\`d ibn Abi
Waqqas made his right of vote to \`Abd ar-Rahman. This left three
members of the consultative committee out of whom \`Abd ar-Rahman said
that he was willing to give up his own right of vote if \`Ali (p.b.u.h.)
and \`Uthman gave him the right to choose one of them or one of these
two should acquire this right by withdrawing. This was a trap in which
\`Ali had been entangled from all sides namely that either he should
abandon his own right or else allow \`Abd ar-Rahman to do as he wished.
The first case was not possible for him; that is, to give up his own
right and elect \`Uthman or \`Abd ar-Rahman. So, he clung to his right,
while \`Abd ar-Rahman separating himself from it assumed this power and
said to Amir al-mu'minin, "I pay you allegiance on your following the
Book of Allah, the sunnah of the Prophet and the conduct of the two
Shaykhs, (Abu Bakr and \`Umar). \`Ali replied, "Rather on following the
Book of Allah, the sunnah of the Prophet and my own findings." When he
got the same reply even after repeating the question thrice he turned to
\`Uthman saying, "Do you accept these conditions." He had no reason to
refuse and so he agreed to the conditions and allegiance was paid to
him. When Amir al mu'minin saw his rights being thus trampled he said:
"This is not the first day when you behaved against us. I have only to
keep good patience. Allah is the Helper against whatever you say. By
Allah, you have not made \`Uthman Caliph but in the hope that he would
give back the Caliphate to you." After recording the events of ash-Shura
(consultative committee), Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written that when
allegiance had been paid to \`Uthman, \`Ali addressed \`Uthman and \`Abd
ar-Rahman saying, "May Allah sow the seed of dissension among you," and
so it happened that each turned a bitter enemy of the other and \`Abd
ar-Rahman did not ever after speak to \`Uthman till death. Even on death
bed he turned his face on seeing him. On seeing these events the
question arises whether ash-Shura (consultative committee) means
confining the matter to six persons, thereafter to three and finally to
one only. Also whether the condition of following the conduct of the two
Shaykhs for Caliphate was put by \`Umar or it was just a hurdle put by
\`Abd ar-Rahman between \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) and the Caliphate, although the
first Caliph did not put forth this condition at the time of nominating
the second Caliph, namely that he should follow the former's footsteps.
What then was the occasion for this condition here? However, Amir
al-mu'minin had agreed to participate in it in order to avoid mischief
and to put an end to arguing so that others should be silenced and
should not be able to claim that they would have voted in his favour and
that he himself evaded the consultative committee and did not give them
an opportunity of selecting him.

[^5]: About the reign of the third Caliph, Amir al-mu'minin says that
soon on \`Uthman's coming to power Banu Umayyah got ground and began
plundering the Bayt al-mal (public fund), and just as cattle on seeing
green grass after drought trample it away, they recklessly fell upon
Allah's money and devoured it. At last this self-indulgence and nepotism
brought him to the stage when people besieged his house, put him to
sword and made him vomit all that he had swallowed. The
maladministration that took place in this period was such that no Muslim
can remain unmoved to see that Companions of high position were lying
uncared for, they were stricken with poverty and surrounded by
pennilessness while control over Bayt al-mal (public fund) was that of
Banu Umayyah, government positions were occupied by their young and
inexperienced persons, special Muslim properties were owned by them,
meadows provided grazing but to their cattle, houses were built but by
them, and orchards were but for them. If any compassionate person spoke
about these excesses his ribs were broken, and if someone agitated this
capitalism he was externed from the city. The uses to which zakat and
charities which were meant for the poor and the wretched and the public
fund which was the common property of the Muslims were put may be
observed from the following few illustrations; 1) al-Hakam ibn
Abi'l-\`As who had been exiled from Medina by the Prophet was allowed
back in the city not only against the Prophet's sunnah but also against
the conduct of the first two Caliphs and he was paid three hundred
thousand Dirhams from the public fund. (Ansab al-ashraf, vol.5, pp.27,
28, 125) 2) al-Walid ibn \`Uqbah who has been named hypocrite in the
Qur'an was paid one hundred thousand Dirhams from the Muslim's public
fund. (al-\`Iqd al-farid, vol.3, p.94) 3) The Caliph married his own
daughter Umm Aban to Marwan ibn al-Hakam and paid him one hundred
thousand Dirhams from the public fund. (Sharh of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol.1,
pp.198-199). 4) He married his daughter \`A'ishah to Harith ibn al-Hakam
and granted him one hundred thousand Dirhams from the public fund.
(ibid.) 5) \`Abdullah ibn Khalid was paid four hundred thousand Dirhams.
(al-Ma\`arif of Ibn Qutaybah, p.84) 6) Allowed the khums (one fifth
religious duty) from Africa (amounting to five hundred thousand Dinars)
to Marwan ibn al-Hakam. (ibid) 7) Fadak which was withheld from the
angelic daughter of the Prophet on the ground of being general charity
was given as a royal favour to Marwan ibn al-Hakam. (ibid.) 8) Mahzur a
place in the commercial area of Medina which had been declared a public
trust by the Prophet was gifted to Harith ibn al-Hakam. (ibid.) 9) In
the meadows around Medina no camel except those of Banu Umayyah were
allowed to graze. (Sharh of Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol.l, p.l99) 10) After his
death (\`Uthman's) one hundred and fifty thousand Dinars (gold coins)
and one million Dirhams (silver coins) were found in his house. There
was no limit to tax free lands; and the total value of the landed estate
he owned in Wadi al-Qura and Hunayn was one hundred thousand Dinars.
There were countless camels and horses. (Muruj adh-dhahab, vol.l, p.435)
11) The Caliph's relations ruled all the principal cities. Thus, at
Kufah, al-Walid ibn \`Uqbah was the governor but when in the state of
intoxication of wine he led the morning prayer in four instead of two
rak\`ah and people agitated he was removed, but the Caliph put in his
place a hypocrite like Sa\`id ibn al-\`As. In Egypt \`Abdullah ibn Sa\`d
ibn Abi Sarh, in Syria Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, and in Basrah,
\`Abdullah ibn \`Amir were the governors appointed by him (ibid.)
