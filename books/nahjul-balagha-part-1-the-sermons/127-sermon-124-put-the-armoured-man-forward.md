Put the armoured man forward and keep the unarmoured one behind. Grit
your teeth because this will make the swords skip off the skull, and
dodge on the sides of the spears for it changes the direction of their
blades. Close the eyes because it strengthens the spirit and gives peace
to the heart. Kill the voices because this will keep off spiritlessness.

فَقَدِّمُوا الدَّارِعَ، وَأَخِّرُوا الْحَاسِرَ، وَعَضُّوا عَلَى
الاْضْرَاسِ فَإِنَّهُ أَنْبَى لِلسُّيُوفِ عَنِ الْهَامِ، وَالْتَوُوا

Do not let your banner bend down, nor leave it alone. Do not give it to
anyone except the brave and the defenders of honour among you because
they alone endure the befalling of troubles; they surround the banners
and encircle them on both sides, their rear and their front. They do not
separate from them lest they give them over (to the enemy). They do not
go ahead of them lest they leave them alone. Everyone should deal with
his adversary and also help his comrade by his own life, and should not
leave the adversary to his comrade lest both his own adversary and his
comrade join against him.

By Allah, even if you run away from the sword of today you would not
remain safe from the sword of the next world. You are the foremost among
the Arabs and great figures. Certainly in running away there is the
wrath of Allah, unceasing disgrace and lasting shame.

And certainly a runner-away does not lengthen his life, nor does any
thing come to intervene between him and his day (of death). Who is there
to go towards Allah like the thirsty going to the water? Paradise lies
under the edges of spears. Today the reputations (about the valour of
warriors) will be tested.

By Allah! I am more eager to meet them (in combat) than they are for
(returning to) their houses. O My God! If they reject truth disperse
their group, divide their words (opinion) and destroy them on account of
their sins.

They will not budge from their stand till the continuous striking of
spears causes piercings (of wounds) through which wind may pass, and the
hitting of swords cuts through the skull, cleaves bones and breaks
forearms and legs, till they are attacked by contingent after contingent
and assaulted by detachments which are followed by reserves for support,
till their cities are continuously assailed by force after force, and
till the horses trample even the extreme ends of the lands, the tracks
of their beast and their meadows.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says**: *"ad-da\`q"* means trampling, e.g.,
*"taduqqu'l-khuyulu bihawafiriha ardahum"* (the horses trample the
ground with their hoofs). *"nawahini ardihim"* means lands opposite each
other, it is said, *"manazilu bani fulanin tatanaharu"* meaning the
'houses of so-and-so are opposite each other.'

[^1]: Amir al-mu'minin delivered this Sermon on the occasion of the
battle of Siffin. This battle was fought in the year 37 A.H. between
Amir al-mu'minin and the Governor of Syria (ash-Sham), Mu\`awiyah, for
the so-called avenging for the killing of Caliph \`Uthman. But in
reality it was nothing more than Mu\`awiyah who had been the Autonomous
Governor of Syria from Caliph \`Umar's days not wanting to lose that
position by swearing allegiance to Amir al-mu'minin but wanting to keep
his authority intact by exploiting the killing of Caliph \`Uthman, for
later events proved that after securing the government he did not take
any practical step to avenge \`Uthman's blood, and never spoke, not even
through omission, about the killers of \`Uthman. Although from the first
day Amir al-mu'minin realised that war was inevitable, it was still
necessary to exhaust all pleas. Therefore when on Monday the 12th Rajeb,
36 A.H. he returned to Kufah after the battle of Jamal he sent Jarir ibn
\`Abdallah al-Bajali with a letter to Mu\`awiyah at Damascus wherein he
wrote that the muhajirun and the ansar had sworn allegiance to him and
that he too should first swear him allegiance and thereafter place the
case of \`Uthman's killing before him so that he could pass verdict
thereon according to the Qur'an and Sunnah. But Mu\`awiyah detained
Jarir on several pretexts and after consulting \`Amr ibn al-\`As staged
a revolt on the excuse of \`Uthman's killing, and with the help of
important persons of Syria convinced the ignorant people that the
liability for \`Uthman's life lay on \`Ali (p.b.u.h) and that he, with
his conduct had encouraged the besiegers and had given them protection.
Meanwhile he hung the blood-stained shirt of \`Uthman and the amputated
fingers of his wife Na'ilah bint al-Farafisah on the pulpit in the
Central Mosque of Damascus around which seventy thousand Syrians cried
and swore the pledge to avenge \`Uthman's blood. When Mu\`awiyah had
roused the feelings of the Syrians to such an extent that they were
determined to lay down their lives and be killed, he secured their
allegiance on the cause of avenging \`Uthman's blood and busied himself
in equipping for the battle. Thereafter, he showed all this to Jarir and
then sent him back mortified. When Amir al-mu'minin learnt of these
matters through Jarir ibn \`Abdallah al-Bajali he was forced to rise
against Mu\`awiyah, and ordered Malik ibn Habib al-Yarbu\`i to mobilise
the forces in the valley of An-Nukhaylah. Consequently, people from the
suburbs of Kufah began arriving there in large numbers, till they
exceeded eighty thousand. First of all, Amir al-mu'minin sent a vanguard
contingent, eight thousand strong, under Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi
and another of four thousand strong under Shurayh ibn Hani al-Harithi
towards Syria. After the departure of this vanguard contingent he
himself set out for Syria at the head of the remaining army on Wednesday
the 5th of Shawwal. When he was out of the boundary of Kufah he offered
zuhr (noon) prayer and after staying at Dayr Abi Musa, Nahr (river)
Nars, Qubbat Qubbin, Babil, Dayr Ka\`b, Karbala', Sabat, Bahurasini,
al-Anbar and al-Jazirah arrived at ar-Riqqah. The people of this place
were in favour of \`Uthman, and at this very place Simak ibn Makhtamah
al-Asadi was putting up with his eight hundred men. These people had
left Kufah to join Mu\`awiyah after deserting Amir al-mu'minin; when
they had seen Amir al-mu'minin's force they had dismantled the bridge
over the River Euphrates so that Amir al-mu'minin's army should not
cross over to the other side of the River. But at the threatening of
Malik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha\`i they were frightened, and
after consultations among themselves they put the bridge together again
and Amir al-mu'minin passed over it with his army. When he alighted on
the other side of the River he saw that Ziyad and Shurayh were also
putting up there along with their men since both of them had adopted the
land route. When, on reaching here, they found that Mu\`awiyah was
advancing with his armies towards the Euphrates and thinking that they
would not be able to face him, they stopped there waiting for Amir
al-mu'minin. When they had given the reason for their stopping there,
Amir al-mu'minin accepted their plea and sent them forward. When they
reached Sur ar-Rum they found that Abu al-A\`war as-Sulami was camping
there with his army. Both of them informed Amir al-mu'minin of this,
whereupon he despatched Ma1ik ibn al-Harith al-Ashtar an-Nakha\`i in
their wake as the Officer in Command and cautioned him not to initiate
the fighting but to try to counsel them and apprise them of the correct
position as far as possible. In this way, on reaching there Malik
al-Ashtar encamped a little distance away. Fighting could have commenced
any moment, but he did not interfere with the other side nor did he take
any step by which fighting could have been commenced. But Abu al-A\`war
suddenly attacked them at night, whereupon they took their swords out of
the sheaths and prepared to repulse them. Clashes between the two sides
went on for sometime but in the end, taking benefit of the darkness of
night Abu al-A\`war fled away. Since fighting had already commenced,
soon after the appearance of dawn an Iraqi commander, Hashim ibn \`Utbah
al-Mirqal az-Zuhri, took his position in the battlefield. From the other
side also a contingent came to face him, and the flames of fighting rose
high. At last Malik al-Ashtar challenged Abu al-A\`war to fight him, but
he did not dare to face him, and towards the evening Malik al-Ashtar
went onwards with his men. The next day Amir al-mu'minin reached there
with his force and set off for Siffin with the vanguard contingent and
other forces. Mu\`awiyah had already reached there and had set up his
bases. He had also placed a guard on the Euphrates and had occupied it.
On reaching there Amir al-mu'minin sent him word to remove the guard
from Euphrates, but he refused, whereupon the Iraqis took out their
swords and in a courageous attack captured the Euphrates. When this
stage was over Amir al-mu'minin sent Bashir ibn \`Amr al-Ansari, Sa\`id
ibn Qays al-Hamdani and Shabath ibn Rib\`i at-Tamimi to Mu\`awiyah to
apprise him of the consequences of war and to make him agree to
settlement and allegiance. But his reply was that they could not by any
means let \`Uthman's blood remain neglected, and that now the sword
alone would arbitrate between them. Consequently in the month of
Dhi'l-hijjah 36 A.H. both the parties decided on war and warriors from
each side came out into the field to face their adversary. Those who
entered the battlefield from Amir al-mu'minin's side were: Hujr ibn
\`Adi al-Kindi, Shabath ibn Rib\`i at-Tamimi, Khalid ibn al-Mu\`ammar,
Ziyad ibn an-Nadr al-Harithi, Ziyad ibn Khasafah at-Taymi, Sa\`id ibn
Qays al-Hamdani, Qays ibn Sa\`d al-Ansari and Malik ibn al-Harith
al-Ashtar an-Nakha\`i while from the Syrians there were, \`Abd ar-Rahman
ibn Khalid ibn Walid al-Makhzuni, Abu al-A\`war as-Sulami, Habib ibn
Maslamah al-Fihri, \`Abdallah ibn Dhi'l-Kala\` al-Himyari, \`Ubaydallah
ibn \`Umar ibn al-Khattab, Shurahbil ibn Simt al-Kindi, and Hamzah ibn
Malik al-Hamdani. When the month of Dhi'l-hijjah came to end the
fighting had to be stopped for Muharram, but from the first of Safar
fighting was resumed and both parties arrayed themselves opposite each
other, equipped with swords, spears and other weapons. On Amir
al-mu'minin's side Malik al-Ashtar was in command of the horsemen and
\`Ammar ibn Yasir of the foot soldiers of Kufah while Sahl ibn Hunayf
al-Ansari was in command of the horsemen and Qays ibn Sa\`d of the foot
soldiers of Basrah. The banner of the army was given to Hashim ibn
\`Utbah. In the army of the Syrians on the right hand contingent Ibn
Dhi'l-Kala\` was in command, while on the left hand contingent Habib ibn
Maslamah, on horsemen \`Amr ibn al-\`As and on foot soldiers ad-Dahhak
ibn Qays al-Fihri were in command. On the first day Malik ibn al-Ashtar
entered the battle-field with his men, and from the other side Habib ibn
Maslamah came out with his men to face him and from both sides a fierce
battle ensued. Throughout the day swords clashed with swords and spears
with spears. Next day, Hashim ibn \`Utbah came out with \`Ali's army and
from the other side Abu al-A\`war with his footmen came to face him.
When the two armies approached near to each other, horsemen fell upon
horsemen and footmen upon footmen and continued attacking each other.
and they endured with great patience and steadfastness. On the third
day, \`Ammar ibn Yasir and Ziyad ibn an-Nadr came out with horsemen and
foot soldiers and from the other side \`Amr ibn al-\`As came forward
with a big force. Ziyad attacked the horsemen of the opposite side and
Malik al-Ashtar attacked the foot soldiers so furiously that the enemy's
men lost ground and, failing to offer resistance, returned to their
camps. On the fourth day Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah appeared on the
battle-field with his men. From the other side \`Ubaydallah ibn \`Umar
came forward with the Syrian army and both the armies had a serious
encounter. On the fifth day \`Abdallah ibn \`Abbas came forward and from
the other side al-Walid ibn \`Uqba ibn Abi Mu\`ayt came to face him.
\`Abdallah ibn \`Abbas carried the assaults with great steadfastness and
courage and gave such a brave fight that the enemy left the field in
retreat. On the sixth day Qays ibn Sa\`d al-Ansari came forward with the
army and to face him Ibn Dhi'l-Kala\` came out with his contingent, and
such a severe fighting ensued that at every step bodies were seen
falling and blood flowing like streams. At last the darkness of the
night separated the two armies. On the seventh day Malik al-Ashtar came
out and to face him, Habib ibn Maslamah came forward with his men, and
fighting raged till zuhr (noon). On the eighth day Amir al-mu'minin
himself came out with the army and made such an assault that the entire
battlefield quaked, and piercing through the ranks and warding off shots
of arrows and spears he came and stood between both the lines. Then he
challenged Mu\`awiyah, whereupon the latter, along with \`Amr ibn
al-\`As, came a bit closer. Then Amir al-mu'minin said to him: "Come out
and face me. Let whoever kills the other be the ruler." Whereupon \`Amr
ibn al-\`As said to Mu\`awiyah: "\`Ali is right. Gather up a little
courage and face him. Mu\`awiyah replied: "l am not prepared to waste my
life ar your taunting." Saying this he went back. When Amir al-mu'minin
saw him retreating he smiled and himself too returned. The daring with
which Amir al-mu'minin led the attacks in Siffin can only be called a
miraculous feat. Thus, whenever he came out challenging in the
battlefield, the enemy lines were dispersed into utter disarray and
confusion, and even courageous combatants hesitated to appear against
him. That is why on a few occasions he came onto the battlefield in
changed dress so that the enemy should not recognise him and someone
should be prepared to engage with him personally. Once \`Arar ibn Ad'ham
came from the other side to engage with al-\`Abbas ibn Rabi\`ah
al-Harith ibn \`Abd al-Muttalib. They remained engaged but neither could
defeat the other, until al-\`Abbas chanced to see that a link of his
adversary's armour was loose. With a swift stroke he entangled the point
of his sword in it, and then with a quick jerk he cut through a few more
links. Then with true aim he gave such a blow that his sword went
straight into his bosom. Seeing this, people raised the call of takbir.
Mu\`awiyah was startled at this noise and on coming to know that \`Arar
ibn Ad'ham had been slain he was much disturbed and shouted if there was
anyone to take revenge for \`Arar ibn Ad'ham and kill al-\`Abbas,
whereupon some tired swordsmen of the tribe of Lakhm came out
challenging al-\`Abbas. Al-\`Abbas said he would come after taking his
Chief's permission. Saying al-\`Abbas came to Amir al-mu'minin to seek
permission. Amir al-mu'minin detained him, put on al-\`Abbas's dress.
and riding on al-\`Abbas's horse entered the battlefield. Taking him to
be al-\`Abbas, the Lakhms said: "So you have got your Chief's
permission." In reply Amir al-mu'minin recited the following verse:
Permission (to fight) is given unto those upon whom war is made for they
have been oppressed, and verily, to help them, Allah is Most Potent.
(Qur'an, 22:39) Now one man came out from the other side shouting like
an elephant, ran amok and assaulted Amir al-mu'minin, but he avoided the
blow and then gave such a clean cut with his sword to the other's back
that he was split into two. People thought the blow had gone without
avail, but when his horse jumped his two separate parts fell on the
ground. After him another man came out but he too was finished in the
twinkling of an eye. Then Amir al-mu'minin challenged others but from
the strokes of his sword the enemy came to know that it was Amir
al-mu'minin in the dress of al-\`Abbas and so none dared come to face
him. On the ninth day the right wing was under the command of \`Abdullah
ibn Budayl and the left wing under that of \`Abdullah ibn al-\`Abbas. In
the centre was Amir al-mu'minin himself. On the other side Habib ibn
Maslamah commanded the Syrian army. When both the lines had come face to
face with each other, the valiant soldiers drew out their swords and
pounced upon one another like ferocious lions, and fighting raged on all
sides. The banner of the right wing Amir al-mu'minin's army was
revolving in the hands of Banu Hamdan. Whenever anyone of them fell,
martyred, someone else would pick up the banner. First of all Kurayb ibn
Shurayh raised the banner, on his fall Shurahbil ibn Shurayh took it up,
then Marthad ibn Shurayh, then Hubayrah ibn Shurayh then Yarim ibn
Shurayh, then Sumayr ibn Shurayh and after the killing of all these six
brothers the banner was taken up by Sufyan, then \`Abd, then Kurayb, the
three sons of Zayd, who all fell martyred. After that the banner was
lifted by two brothers (sons) of Bashir namely \`Umayr and al-Harith and
when they too fell martyred, Wahb ibn Kurayb took up the banner. On this
day the enemy's greater attention was on the right wing and its assaults
were so fierce that the men lost ground and began to retreat from the
battlefield. Only three hundred men remained with the Officer in Command
\`Abdullah ibn Budayl. On seeing this Amir al-mu'minin asked Malik
al-Ashtar to call them back and challenge them as to where they were
fleeing. "If the days of life are over they cannot avoid death by
running away." Now the defeat of the right wing could not be without
effect on the left wing, so Amir al-mu'minin turned to the left wing and
advanced forward, forcing through the enemy lines, whereupon a slave of
Banu Umayyah named Ahmar said to him, "Allah may make me die if I fail
to slay you today." On hearing this Amir al-mu'minin's slave Kaysan
leapt over him but was killed by him. When Amir al-mu'minin saw this he
caught him by the skirt of his armour and, picking him up, threw him
down so forcefully that all his joints were smashed, whereupon Imam
Hasan (p.b.u.h.) and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah came forward and
despatched him to Hell. Meanwhile, after having been called to Malik
al-Ashtar and his having made them feel ashamed, the retreaters came
back and again assaulted so steadfastly that pushing back the enemy they
reached the place where \`Abdullah ibn Budayl was surrounded by the
enemy. When he saw his own men he picked up courage and leapt towards
Mu\`awiyah's tent with drawn sword. Malik al-Ashtar tried to stop him
but he couldn't, and, killing seven Syrians, he reached the tent of
Mu\`awiyah. When Mu\`awiyah noticed him close by he ordered him to be
stoned, as a result of which he was overpowered and the Syrians crowded
over him and killed him. When Malik al-Ashtar saw this he proceeded
forward with the combatants of Banu Hamdan and Banu Madh'hij for an
attack on Mu\`awiyah, and began dispersing the contingent on guard
around him. When, out of the five circles of his guards only one
remained to be dispersed, Mu\`awiyah put his foot in the stirrup of his
horse in order to run away, but on someone's encouragement again
stopped. On another side of the battlefield a tumult was raging from one
end to the other by the swords of \`Ammar ibn Yasir and Hashim ibn
\`Utbah. From whatever side \`Ammar passed, the companions (of the Holy
Prophet) flocked around him and then made such a joint assault that
destruction spread throughout the enemy lines. When Mu\`awiyah saw them
advancing he threw his fresh forces towards them. But he continued
displaying the excellence of his bravery under the storm of swords and
spears. At last Abu al-\`Adiyah al-Juhani hit him with a spear from
which he could not balance himself and then Ibn Hawiy (Jawn as-Saksiki)
came forward and slew him. \`Ammar ibn Yasir's death caused tumult in
Mu\`awiyah's ranks because about him they had heard the Holy Prophet (S)
having said: " \`Ammar will be killed at the hands of a rebellious
party." Thus before he fell as martyr Dhu'l-Kala\` had said to \`Amr ibn
al-\`As: "I see \`Ammar on \`Ali's side; are we that rebellious party?"
\`Amr ibn al-\`As had assured him that eventually \`Ammar would join
them, but when he killed fighting on \`Ali's side the rebellious party
stood exposed and no scope was left for any other interpretation.
Nevertheless Mu\`awiyah started telling the Syrians that: "We did not
kill \`Ammar, but \`Ali did it because he brought him to the
battlefield." When Amir al-mu'minin heard this cunning sentence he
remarked: "In that case the Holy Prophet (S) killed Hamzah as he had
brought him to the battlefield of Uhud." Hashim ibn \`Utbah also fell in
this conflict. He was killed by al-Harith ibn Mundhir at-Tanukhi. After
him the banner of the contingent was taken over by his son \`Abdullah.
When such fearless warriors were gone Amir al-mu'minin said to the
warriors from the tribes of Hamdan and Rabi\`ah: "To me you are like
armour and spear. Get up and teach these rebels a lesson. "
Consequently, twelve thousand combatants of the tribes of Rabi\`ah and
Hamdan stood up, swords in hand. The banner was taken up by Hudayn ibn
al-Mundhir. Entering the lines of the enemy, they used their swords in
such a way that heads began to drop, bodies fell in huge heaps and on
every side streams of blood flowed. And the assaults of these swordsmen
knew no stopping till the day began to end with all its devastation and
the gloom of eve set in, ushering in that fearful night which is known
in history as the night of al-Harir, wherein the clashing of weapons,
the hoofs of horses and the hue and cry of the Syrians created such
notice that even voices reaching the ears could not be heard. On Amir
al-mu'minin's side, his wrong-crushing slogans raised waves of courage
and valour, and on the enemy's side they shook the hearts in their
bosoms. The battle was at its zenith. The quivers of the bowmen had
become empty. The stalks of the spears had been broken. Hand to hand
fighting went on with swords only and dead bodies collected in heaps,
till by morning the number of killed had exceeded thirty thousand. On
the tenth day Amir al-mu'minin's men showed the same morale. On the
right wing Malik al-Ashtar held the command and on the left wing
\`Abdullah ibn al-\`Abbas. Assaults went on like the assaults of new
soldiers. Signs of defeat appeared on the Syrians, and they were about
to leave the battlefield and run away, when five hundred Qur'ans were
raised on spears changing the entire face of the battle. Moving swords
stopped, the weapon of deceit was successful, and the way was clear for
wrong to hold its sway. In this battle forty-five thousand Syrians were
killed while twenty-five thousand Iraqis fell as martyrs. (Kitab Siffin
by Nasr ibn Muzahim al-Minqari [d. 212 A.H.] and at-Tarikh at-Tabari,
vol. 1, pp. 3256-3349).
