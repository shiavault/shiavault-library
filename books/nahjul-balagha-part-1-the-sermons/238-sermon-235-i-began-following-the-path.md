Sermon 235: I began following the path….
========================================

*In this sermon Amir al-mu'minin has related his own condition after the
Prophet's migration till his meeting with him.* [^1]

I began following the path adopted by the Prophet and treading on the
lines of his remembrance till I reached al-\`Arj.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فَجَعَلْتُ أَتْبَعُ مَأْخَذَ رَسُولِ الله (صلى الله عليه وآله)
فَأَطَأُ ذِكْرَهُ، حَتَّى انْتَهَيْتُ إِلَى الْعَرَجِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi** says: Amir al-mu'minin's words *"faata'u
dhikrahu"* constitute the highest forms of brevity and eloquence. He
means to say that he was being given news about the Prophet from the
commencement of his setting out till he reached this place, and he has
expressed this sense in this wonderful expression.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال السيد الشريف رضي الله عته في حديث طويل: فقوله (عليه السلام):
«فَأطَأُ ذِكْرَهُ»، من الكلام الذي رُمِيَ به إلى غايتي والفصاحة
والايجاز، وأراد أني كنتُ أُعْطي خبره(عليه السلام) من بدء خروجي إلى أن
انتهيتُ إلى هذا الموضع، وكنّى عن ذلك بهذه الكناية العجيبة.

(1) Ibn al-'Athir, *al-Nihayah,* V, *(w.t.'a).*

[^1]: Since the commencement of prophethood, the Prophet remained in
Mecca for thirteen years. For him, this period was of the severest
oppression and destitution. The unbelievers of the Quraysh had closed
all the doors of livelihood upon him, and had left no deficiency in
inflicting hardships upon him, so much so that in order to take his life
they began contriving how to do away with him. Forty of their nobles
assembled in the hall of audience (Dar an-Nadwah) for consultation, and
decided that one individual should be picked out from every tribe and
they should jointly attack him. In this way, Banu Hashim would not dare
to face all the tribes, and the matter would quieten down on the payment
of blood price. To give a practical shape to this scheme, these people
sat in ambush near the house of the Prophet on the night of the first of
Rabi\` al-awwal, so that when the prophet slept in his bed he would be
attacked. On this side the preparation for killing him was complete, and
on the other side Allah informed him of all the intrigues of the Quraysh
unbelievers and commanded him to make \`Ali (p.b.u.h.) sleep on his bed
and himself to emigrate to Medina. The Prophet sent for \`Ali (p.b.u.h.)
and disclosing to him his plan, said: "Ali, you lie on my bed." Amir
al-mu'minin enquired: "O' Messenger of Allah, will your life be saved by
my sleeping here?" The Prophet said: "Yes." Hearing this Amir
al-mu'minin performed a prostration in thanks-giving and, exposing
himself fully to the danger, lay on the Prophet's bed while the Prophet
left from the rear door. The Quraysh unbelievers were peeping and
getting ready for the attack but Abu Lahab said: "It is not proper to
attack in the night because there are women and children also in the
house. When morning dawns you attack him, but keep watch during night
that he should not move anywhere." Consequently, they kept their eyes on
the bed throughout the night and soon, on the appearance of the dawn,
proceeded forward stealthily. Hearing the sound of their footsteps, Amir
al-mu'minin removed the covering from his face and stood up. The Quraysh
gazed at him with stretched eyes as to whether it was an illusion or
fact. After making sure that it was \`Ali they enquired, "Where is
Muhammad?" and \`Ali replied, "Did you entrust him to me, that now you
are asking me?" They had no reply to this. Men ran to chase him but
found footprints only up to the cave of Thawr. Beyond that there were
neither footprints nor any sign of hiding in the cave. They came back
bewildered while the Prophet after staying in the cave for three days
left for Medina. Amir al-mu'minin passed these three days in Mecca,
returned to the people their properties lying in trust with the Prophet
and set off towards Medina to join the Prophet. Upto al-\`Arj which is a
place between Mecca and Medina, he kept getting news about the Prophet
and he continued his anxious march in his search till he met the Prophet
at Quba on the twelfth of Rabi\` al-awwal, and entered Medina with him.
