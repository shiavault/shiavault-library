O Kufah, as though I see you being drawn like the tanned leather of
\`Ukazi[^1] in the market, you are being scraped by calamities and being
ridden by severe troubles. I certainly[^2] know that if any tyrant
intends evil for you Allah will afflict him with worry and fling him
with a killer (set someone on him to kill him).

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَأَنَّي بِكِ يَاكُوفَةُ تُمَدِّينَ مَدَّ الاْدَيمِ الْعُكَاظِيِّ،
تُعْرَكِينَ بِالنَّوَازِلِ، وَتُرْكَبِينَ بِالزَّلاَزِلِ، وَإِنَّي
لاَعْلَمُ أَنَّهُ مَاأَرَادَ بِكِ جَبَّارٌ سُوءاً إِلاَّ ابْتَلاَهُ
اللهُ بِشَاغِل، وَرَمَاهُ بِقَاتِل!

[^1]: During pre-Islamic days a market used to be organised every year
near Mecca. Its name was \`Ukaz where mostly hides were traded as a
result of which leather was attributed to it. Besides sale and purchase
literary meetings were also arranged and Arabs used to attract
admiration by reciting their works. After Islam, because of the better
congregation in the shape of hajj this market went down.

[^2]: This prophecy of Amir al-mu'minin was fulfilled word by word and
the world saw how the people who had committed tyranny and oppression on
the strength of their masterly power had to face tragic end and what
ways of their destruction were engendered by their blood-shedding and
homicidal activities. Consequently, the end of Ziyad ibn Abih (son of
unknown father) was that when he intended to deliver a speech for
vilification of Amir al-mu'minin suddenly paralysis overtook him and he
could not get out of his bed thereafter. The end of the bloodshed
perpetrated by \`Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad was that he fell a prey to leprosy
and eventually blood thirsty swords put him to death. The ferocity of
al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf ath-Thaqafi drove him to the fate that snakes
cropped up in his stomach as a result of which he died after severe
pain. \`Umar ibn Hubayrah al-Fazari died of leucoderma. Khalid ibn
\`Abdillah al-Qasri suffered the hardships of prison and was killed in a
very bad way. Mus\`ab ibn az-Zubayr and Yazid ibn al-Muhallab ibn Abi
Sufrah were also killed by swords.
