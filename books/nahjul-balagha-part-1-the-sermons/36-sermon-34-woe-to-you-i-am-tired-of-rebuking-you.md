Sermon 34: Woe to you! I am tired of rebuking you ...
=====================================================

*To prepare the people for fighting with the people of Syria
(ash-Sham)*[^1]

*After dealing with the Kharijites, Amir al-mu’minin rebukes the people
and counsels them to be on the right:*

Woe to you. I am tired of rebuking you. Do you accept this worldly life
in place of the next life? Or disgrace in place of dignity? When I
invite you to fight your enemy your eyes revolve as though you are in
the clutches of death, and in the senselessness of last moments.

My pleadings are not understood by you and you remain stunned. It is as
though your hearts are affected with madness so that you do not
understand. You have lost my confidence for good. Neither are you a
support for me to lean upon, nor a means to honour and victory. Your
example is that of the camels whose protector has disappeared, so that
if they are collected from one side they disperse away from the other
side.

اُفٍ لَكُمْ! لَقَدْ سَئِمْتُ عِتَابَكُمْ! أَرَضِيتُمْ بِالْحَيَاةِ
الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الاْخِرَةِ عِوَضاً؟ وَبِالذُّلِّ مِنَ الْعِزِّ
خَلَفاً؟ إِذَا دَعَوْتُكُمْ إِلَى جِهَادِ عَدُوِّكُمْ دَارَتْ
أَعْيُنُكُمْز، كَأَنَّكُمْ مِنَ الْمَوْتِ فِي غَمْرَةٍ وَمِنَ
الذُّهُولِ في سَكْرَةٍ، يُرْتَجُ عَلَيْكُمْ حَوَارِي فَتَعْمَهُونَ
فَكَأَنَّ قُلُوبَكُمْ مَأْلُوسَةٌ فَأَنْتُمْ لاَ تَعْقِلُونَ. مَا
أَنْتُمْ لي بِثِقَةٍ سَجِيسَ اللَّيَالي وَمَاأَنْتُمْ بِرُكْنٍ يُمَالُ
بِكُمْ وَلاَزَوَافِرُ عِزٍّ يُفْتَقَرُ إِلَيْكُمْ. مَا أَنْتُمْ إِلاَّ
كَإِبِلٍ ضَلَّ رُعَاتُهَا، فَكُلَّمَا جُمِعَتْ مِنْ جَانِبٍ
انْتَشَرَتْ مِن آخَرَ،

By Allah, how bad are you for igniting flames of war. You are intrigued
against but do not intrigue (against the enemy). Your boundaries are
decreasing but you do not get enraged over it. Those against you do not
sleep but you are unmindful. By Allah, those who leave matters one for
the other are subdued. By Allah, I believed about you that if battle
rages and death hovers around you, you will cut away from the son of Abi
Talib like the severing of head from the trunk.[^2]

لَبِئْسَ ـ لَعَمْرُ اللهِ ـ سُعْرُ نَارِ الْحَرْبِ أَنْتُمْ!
تُكَادُونَ وَلاَ تَكِيدُونَ، وَتُنْتَقَصُ أَطْرَافُكُمْ فَلاَ
تَمْتَعِضُونَ لاَ يُنَامُ عَنْكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ في غَفْلَةٍ سَاهُونَ،
غُلِبَ وَاللهِ الْمُتَخَاذِلُونَ! وَأيْمُ اللهِ إِنِّي لاَظُنُّ بِكُمْ
أنْ لَوْ حَمِسَ الْوَغَىي، وَاسْتَحَرَّ الْمَوْتُ قَدِ انْفَرَجْتُمْ

By Allah, he who makes it possible for his adversary to so overpower him
as to remove the flesh (from his bones), crush his bones and cut his
skin into pieces, then it means that his helplessness is great and his
heart surrounded within the sides of his chest is weak. You may become
like this if you wish. But for me, before I allow it I shall use my
sharp edged swords of al-Mushrafiyyah which would cut as under the bones
of the head and fly away arms and feet. Thereafter, Allah will do
whatever He wills.

وَاللهِ إِنَّ امْرَأً يُمَكِّنُ عَدُوَّهُ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ يَعْرُقُ
لَحْمَهُ وَيَهْشِمُ عَظْمَهُ، وَيَفْرِي جِلْدَهُ، لَعَظِيمٌ عَجْزُهُ،
ضَعِيفٌ ماضُمَّتْ عَلَيْهِ جَوَانِحُ صَدْرِهِ أَنْتَ فَكُنْ ذَاكَ إِنْ
شِئْتَ، فَأَمَّا أَنَا فَوَاللهِ دُونَ أَنْ أُعْطِيَ ذلِكَ ضَرْبٌ
بِالْمَشْرَفِيَّةِ تَطِيرُ مِنْهُ فَرَاشُ الْهَامِ وَتَطِيحُ
السَّوَاعِدُ وَالاْقْدَامُ، وَيَفْعَلُ اللهُ بَعْدَ ذلِكَ مَا يَشَاءُ.

O people, I have a right over you and you have a right over me. As for
your right over me, that is to counsel you, to pay you your dues fully,
to teach you that you may not remain ignorant and instruct you in
behaviourism that you may act upon. As for my right over you, it is
fulfilment of (the obligation of) allegiance, well-wishing in presence
or in absence, response when I call you and obedience when I order you.

  <p>
أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ! إِنَّ لِي عَلَيْكُمْ حَقّاً، وَلَكُمْ عَلَيَّ
حَقٌّ: فَأَمَّا حَقُّكُمْ عَلَيَّ: فَالنَّصِيحَةُ لَكُمْ، وَتَوْفِيرُ
فَيْئِكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ، وَتَعْلِيمُكُمْ كَيْلا تَجْهَلُوا،
وَتَأْدِيبُكُمْ كَيْما تَعْلَمُوا. وَأَمَّا حَقِّي عَلَيْكُمْ:
فَالوَفَاءُ بِالبَيْعَةِ، وَالنَّصِيحَةُ في الْمَشْهَدِ وَالْمَغِيبِ،
وَالاْجَابَةُ حِينَ أَدْعُوكُمْ، وَالطَّاعَةُ حِينَ آمُرُكُمْ.

[^1]: The word "ash-Sham" was a name used for a vast geographical area
occupied by Muslim countries in those days. This area included
present-day Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Its capital was Damascus.
Wherever the word Syria is mentioned (in this book) it should be
understood in its larger meaning.

[^2]: This sentence is employed for such severance after which there is
no occasion or possibility of joining. The author of Durrah Najafiyyah
has quoted several views in its explanation: i) Ibn Durayd's view is
that it means that. "Just as when the head is severed its joining again
is impossible, in the same way you will not join me after once deserting
me." ii) al-Mufaddal says ar-ra's(head) was the name of a man, and a
village of Syria, Bayt ar-ra's is named after him. This man left his
home and went away somewhere and never again returned to his village
after which the proverb sprang up "you went as ar-ra's had gone." iii)
One meaning of it is that "Just as if the joints of the bones of the
head are opened they cannot be restored, in the same way you will not
join me after cutting from me. iv) It has also been said that this
sentence is in the sense of separating completely. After copying this
meaning from the Sharh of ash-Shaykh Qutbu'd-Din ar-Rawandi, the
commentator Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written that this meaning is not correct
because when the word "ar-ra's" is used in the sense of whole it is not
preceded by "alif" and "lam" v) It is also taken to mean that "You will
so run away from me as one (fleeing for life) to save his head." Besides
this, one or two other meanings have also been stated but being remote
they are disregarded. First of all it was used by the philosopher of
Arabia Aktham ibn Sayfi while teaching unity and concord to his
children. He says: “O my children do not cut away (from each other) at
the time of calamities like the cutting of head, because after that you
will never get together”.
