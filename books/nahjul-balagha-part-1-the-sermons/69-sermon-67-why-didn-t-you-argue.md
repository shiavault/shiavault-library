Sermon 67: Why didn't you argue ...
===================================

*When after the death of the Prophet, news reached Amir al-mu'minin
about the happening in Saqifah of Bani Sa\`idah,*[^1] *he enquired what
the Ansar said. People said that they were asking for one chief from
among them and one from the others, Amir al-mu'minin said:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
في معنى الانصار
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قالوا: لمّا انتهت إلى أميرالمؤمنين (عليه السلام) أنباء السقيفة بعد
وفاة رسول الله(صلى الله عليه وآله)،
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال(عليه السلام): ما قالت الانصار؟
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قالوا: قالت: منا أمير ومنكم أمير، قال عليه السلام: .
  </p>
</blockquote>

Why did you not argue against them (*ansar*) that the Prophet had left
his will that whoever is good among Ansar should be treated well and
whoever is bad should be forgiven.

**People said:** "What is the proof against them in it?"

**Amir al-mu'minin said:**

"If the Government was for them there should have been no will in their
favour."

**Then he said:**

"What did the Quraysh plead?"

**People said:** "They argued that they belong to the lineal tree of the
Prophet.

**Then Amir al-mu'minin said:**

"They defended themselves with the plea of the tree but neglected the
fruit."

[^1]: From what happened in the Saqifah of Bani Sa\`idah it appears that
the greatest argument of muhajirun against ansar and the basis of the
former's success was this very point that since they were the kith and
kin of the Prophet no one else could deserve the Caliphate. On this very
ground the big crowd of ansar became ready to lay down their weapons
before three muhajirun, and the latter succeeded in winning the
Caliphate by presenting their distinction of descent. Thus in connection
with the events of Saqifah at-Tabari writes that when the ansar
assembled in Saqifah of Bani Sa\`idah to swear allegiance on the hand of
Sa\`d ibn \`Ubadah, somehow Abu Bakr, \`Umar and Abu \`Ubaydah ibn
al-Jarrah also got the hint and reached there. \`Umar had thought out
something for this occasion and he rose to speak but Abu Bakr stopped
him, and he himself stood up. After praise of Allah and the immigration
of the muhajirun and their precedence in Islam he said: They are those
who worshipped Allah first of all and accepted belief in Allah and his
Prophet's friends and his Kith and Kin. These alone therefore must
deserve the Caliphate. Whoever clashes with them commits excess. When
Abu Bakr finished his speech al-Hubab ibn al-Mundhir stood up and,
turning to the ansar, he said: "O' group of ansar ! Do not give your
reins in the hands of others. The populace is under your care. You are
men of honour, wealth and tribe and gathering. If the muhajirun have
precedence over you in some matters you too have precedence over them in
other matters. You gave them refuge in your houses. You are the fighting
arm of Islam. With your help Islam stood on its own feet. In your cities
prayer of Allah was established with freedom. Save yourselves from
division and dispersion and stick to your right unitedly. If the
muhajirun do not concede to your right tell them there should be one
chief from us and one from them." No sooner al-Hubab sat down after
saying this then \`Umar rose and spoke thus: This can't be that there be
two rulers at one time. By Allah, the Arabs will never agree to have you
as the head of the state since the Prophet was not from amongst you.
Certainly, the Arabs will not care the least objection in that the
Caliphate is allowed to one in whose house Prophethood rests so that the
ruler should also be from the same house. For those who dissent clear
arguments can be put forth. Whoever comes in conflict with us in the
matter of the authority and rulership of Muhammad (S) he is leaning
towards wrong, is a sinner and is falling into destruction. After
\`Umar, al-Hubab again stood up and said to the ansar, "Look, stick to
your point and do not pay heed to the views of this man or his
supporters. They want to trample your right, if they do not consent turn
him and them out of your cities and appropriate the Caliphate. Who else
than you can deserve it more?" When al-Hubab finished \`Umar scolded
him. There was use of bad words from that side also, and the position
began to worsen. On seeing this Abu \`Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah spoke with
the intention of cooling down ansar and to win them over to his side and
said: "O' ansar ! You are the people who supported us and helped us in
every manner. Do not now change your ways and do not give up your
behaviour." But the ansar refused to change their mind. They were
prepared to swear allegiance to Sa\`d and people just wanted to approach
him when a man of Sa\`d's tribe Bashir ibn \`Amr al-Khazraji stood up
and said: "No doubt we came forward for jihad, and gave support to the
religion, but our aim in doing thus was to please Allah and to obey His
Prophet. It does not behove us to claim superiority and create trouble
in the matter of the caliphate. Muhammad (S) was from Quraysh and they
have a greater right for it, and are more appropriate for it." As soon
as Bashir uttered these words division occurred among the ansar, and
this was his aim, because he could not see a man of his own tribe rising
so high. The muhajirun took the best advantage of this division among
the ansar, and \`Umar and Abu \`Ubaydah decided to swear allegiance to
Abu Bakr. They had just got forward for the act when Bashir first of all
put his hand on that of Abu Bakr and after that \`Umar and Abu \`Ubaydah
swore the allegiance. Then the people of Bashir's tribe came and swore
allegiance, and trampled Sa\`d ibn \`Ubadah under their feet. During
this time Amir al-mu'minin was occupied in the funeral bath and burial
of the Prophet. When afterwards he heard about the assemblage at the
Saqifah and he came to know that the muhajirun had won the score over
ansar by pleading themselves to be from the tribe of the Prophet he
uttered the fine sentence that then argued on the lineal tree being one
but spoiled its fruits, who are the members of his family. That is, if
muhajirun's claim was acceded for being from the lineal tree of the
Prophet, how can those who are the fruits of this tree be ignored? It is
strange that Abu Bakr who connects with the Prophet in the seventh
generation above and \`Umar who connects with him in the ninth
generation above may be held of the tribe and family of the Prophet and
he who was his first cousin, he is refused the status of a brother.
