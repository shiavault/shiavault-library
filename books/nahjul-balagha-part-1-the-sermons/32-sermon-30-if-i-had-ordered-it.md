*Disclosing real facts about assassination of \`Uthman Ibn \`Affan*[^1]

Amir al-mu’minin said:

If I had ordered his assassination I should have been his killer, but if
I had refrained others from killing him I would have been his helper.
The position was that he who helped him cannot now say that he is better
than the one who deserted him while he who deserted him cannot say that
he is better than the one who helped him. I am putting before you his
case. He appropriated (wealth) and did it badly. You protested against
it and committed excess therein. With Allah lies the real verdict
between the appropriator and the protester.

[^1]: \`Uthman is the first Umayyad Caliph of Islam who ascended the
Caliphate on the 1st Muharram, 24 A.H. at the age of seventy and after
having wielded full control and authority over the affairs of the
Muslims for twelve years was killed at their hands on the 18th
Dhi'l-hijjah, 35 A.H. and buried at Hashsh Kawkab. This fact cannot be
denied that \`Uthman's killing was the result of his weaknesses and the
black deeds of his officers, otherwise, there is no reason that Muslims
should have unanimously agreed on killing him while no one except a few
persons of his house stood up to support and defend him. Muslims would
have certainly given consideration to his age, seniority, prestige and
distinction of companionship of the Prophet but his ways and deeds had
so marred the atmosphere that no one seemed prepared to sympathise and
side with him. The oppression and excesses perpetrated on high ranking
companions of the Prophet had roused a wave of grief and anger among the
Arab tribes. Everyone was infuriated and looked at his haughtiness and
wrong doings with disdainful eyes. Thus, due to Abu Dharr's disgrace,
dishonour and exile Banu Ghifar and their associate tribes, due to
\`Abdullah ibn Mas\`ud's merciless beating Banu Hudhayl and their
associates, due to breaking of the ribs of \`Ammar ibn Yasir, Banu
Makhzum and their associates Banu Zuhrah, and due to the plot for the
killing of Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, Banu Taym all had a storm of rage in
their hearts. The Muslims of other cities were also brimful of
complaints at the hands of his officers who under intoxication of wealth
and the effects of luxury did whatever they wished and crushed whomever
they wanted. They had neither fear of punishment from the centre nor
apprehension of any enquiry. People were fluttering to get out of their
talons of oppression but no one was ready to listen to their cries of
pain and restlessness; feelings of hatred were rising but no care was
taken to put them down. The companions of the Prophet were also sick of
him as they saw that peace was destroyed, administration was topsy-turvy
and Islam's features were being metamorphosed. The poor and the starving
were craving for dried crusts while Banu Umayyah were rolling in wealth.
The Caliphate had become a handle for belly-filling and a means of
amassing wealth. Consequently, they too did not lag behind in preparing
the ground for killing him. Rather, it was at their letters and messages
that people from Kufah, Basrah and Egypt had collected in Medina.
Observing this behaviour of the people of Medina, \`Uthman wrote to
Mu\`awiyah: ‘So now, certainly the people of Medina have turned
heretics, have turned faith against obedience and broken the (oath of)
allegiance. So you send to me the warriors of Syria on brisk and sturdy
horses’. The policy of action adopted by Mu\`awiyah on receipt of this
letter also throws light on the condition of the companions. Historian
at-Tabari writes after this: When the letter reached Mu\`awiyah he
pondered over it and considered it bad to openly oppose the companions
of the Prophet since he was aware of their unanimity. In view of these
circumstances to regard the killing of \`Uthman as a consequence of
merely enthusiasm and temporary feelings and to hurl it at some
insurgents is to veil the fact, since all the factors of his opposition
existed within Medina itself, while those coming from without had
collected for seeking redress of their grievances at their call. Their
aim was only improvement of the position, not killing or bloodshed. If
their complaints had been heard then the occasion for this bloodshed
would not have arisen. What happened was that when, having been
disgusted with the oppression and excesses of \`Abdullah ibn Sa\`d ibn
Abi Sarh, who was foster brother of \`Uthman, the people of Egypt
proceeded towards Medina and camped in the valley of Dhakhushub near the
city. They sent a man with a letter to \`Uthman and demanded that
oppression should be stopped, the existing ways should be changed and
repentance should be offered for the future. But instead of giving a
reply \`Uthman got this man turned out of the house and did not regard
their demands worth attention. On this these people entered the city to
raise their voice against this pride and haughtiness, and complained to
the people of this behaviour besides other excesses. On the other side
many people from Kufah and Basrah had also arrived with their complaints
and they, after joining these ones, proceeded forward with the backing
of the people of Medina and confined \`Uthman within his house, although
there was no restriction on his going and coming to the mosque. But in
his sermon on the very first Friday he severely rebuked these people and
even held them accursed, whereupon people got infuriated and threw
pebbles at him as a result of which he lost control and fell from the
pulpit. After a few days his coming and going to the mosque was also
banned. When \`Uthman saw matters deteriorating to this extent he
implored Amir al-mu'minin very submissively to find some way for his
rescue and to disperse the people in whatever way he could. Amir
al-mu'minin said, "On what terms can I ask them to leave when their
demands are justified?" \`Uthman said, "I authorise you in this matter.
Whatever terms you would settle with them I would be bound by them." So
Amir al-mu'minin went and met the Egyptians and talked to them. They
consented to get back on the condition that all the tyrannies should be
wiped off and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr be made governor by removing Ibn Abi
Sarh. Amir al-mu'minin came back and put their demand before \`Uthman
who accepted it without any hesitation and said that to get over these
excesses time was required. Amir al-mu'minin pointed out that for
matters concerning Medina delay had no sense. However, for other places
so much time could be allowed that the Caliph's message could reach
them. \`Uthman insisted that for Medina also three days were needed.
After discussion with the Egyptians Amir al-mu'minin agreed to it also
and took all the responsibility thereof upon himself. Then they
dispersed at his suggestion. Some of them went to Egypt with Muhammad
ibn Abi Bakr while some went to the valley of Dhakhushub and stayed
there and this whole matter ended. On the second day of this event
Marwan ibn al-Hakam said to \`Uthman, "It is good, these people have
gone, but to stop people coming from other cities you should issue a
statement so that they should not come this way and sit quiet at their
places and that statement should be that some people collected in Medina
on hearing some irresponsible talk but when they came to know that
whatever they heard was wrong they were satisfied and have gone back."
\`Uthman did not want to speak such a clear lie but Marwan convinced him
and he agreed, and speaking in the Holy Prophet's mosque, he said: These
Egyptians had received some news about their Caliph and when satisfied
that they were all baseless and wrong they went back to their cities. No
sooner he said this than there was great hue and cry in the mosque, and
people began to shout to \`Uthman, "Offer repentance, fear Allah; what
is this lie you are uttering?" \`Uthman was confused in this commotion
and had to offer repentance. Consequently, he turned to the Ka\`bah,
moaned in the audience of Allah and returned to his house. Probably
after this very event Amir al-mu'minin advised \`Uthman that, "You
should openly offer repentance about your past misdeeds so that these
uprisings should subside for good otherwise if tomorrow people of some
other place come you will again cling to my neck to rid you of them."
Consequently, he delivered a speech in the Prophet's mosque wherein
admitting his mistakes he offered repentance and swore to remain careful
in future. He told the people that when he alighted from the pulpit
their representatives should meet him, and he would remove their
grievances and meet their demands. On this people acclaimed this action
of his and washed away their ill-feelings with tears to a great extent.
When he reached his house after finishing from here Marwan sought
permission to say something but \`Uthman's wife Na'ilah bint Farafisah
intervened. Turning to Marwan she said, "For Allah's sake you keep
quiet. You would say only such a thing as would bring but death to him."
Marwan took it ill and retorted, "You have no right to interfere in
these matters. You are the daughter of that very person who did not know
till his death how to perform ablution." Na'ilah replied with fury, "You
are wrong, and are laying a false blame. Before uttering anything about
my father you should have cast a glance on the features of your father.
But for the consideration of that old man I would have spoken things at
which people would have shuddered but would have confirmed every such
word." When \`Uthman saw the conversation getting prolonged he stopped
them and asked Marwan to tell him what he wished. Marwan said, "What is
it you have said in the mosque, and what repentance you have offered? In
my view sticking to the sin was a thousand times better than this
repentance because however much the sins may multiply there is always
scope for repentance, but repentance by force is no repentance. You have
said what you have but now see the consequences of this open
announcement, that crowds of people are at your door. Now go forward and
fulfil their demands." \`Uthman then said, "Well, I have said what I
have said, now you deal with these people. It is not in my power to deal
with them." Consequently, finding out his implied consent Marwan came
out and addressing the people spoke out, "Why have you assembled here?
Do you intend to attack or to ransack? Remember, you cannot easily
snatch away power from our hands, take out the idea from your hearts
that you would subdue us. We are not to be subdued by anyone. Take away
your black faces from here. Allah may disgrace and dishonour you." When
people noticed this changed countenance and altered picture they rose
from there full of anger and rage and went straight to Amir al-mu'minin
and related to him the whole story. On hearing it Amir al-mu'minin was
infuriated and immediately went to \`Uthman and said to him, "Good
Heavens. How badly you have behaved with the Muslims. You have forsaken
faith for the sake of a faithless and characterless man and have lost
all wit. At least you should have regard and consideration for your own
promise. What is this that at Marwan's betokening you have set off with
folded eyes. Remember he will throw you in such a dark well that you
will never be able to come out of it. You have become the carrier animal
of Marwan so that he can ride on you howsoever he desires and put you on
whatever wrong way he wishes. In future I shall never intervene in your
affair nor tell people anything. Now you should manage your own
affairs." Saying all this Amir al-mu'minin got back and Na'ilah got the
chance, she said to \`Uthman, "Did I not tell you to get rid of Marwan
otherwise he would put such a stain on you that it would not be removed
despite all effort. Well, what is the good in following the words of one
who is without any respect among the people and low before their eyes.
Make \`Ali agree otherwise remember that restoring the disturbed state
of affairs is neither within your power nor in that of Marwan." \`Uthman
was impressed by this and sent a man after Amir al-mu'minin but he
refused to meet him. There was no siege around \`Uthman but shame
deterred him. With what face could he come out of the house? But there
was no way without coming out. Consequently, he came out quietly in the
gloom of night and reaching Amir al-mu'minin's place, he moaned his
helplessness and loneliness, offered excuses, and also assured him of
keeping promises but Amir al-mu'minin said, "You make a promise in the
Prophet's mosque standing before all the people but it is fulfilled in
this way that when people go to you they are rebuked and even abuses are
hurled at them. When this is the state of your undertakings which the
world has seen, then how and on what ground can I trust any word of
yours in future. Do not have any expectation from me now. I am not
prepared to accept any responsibility on your behalf. The tracks are
open before you. Adopt whichever way you like and tread whatever track
you choose." After this talk \`Uthman came back and began blaming Amir
al-mu'minin in retort to the effect that all the disturbances were
rising at his instance and that he was not doing anything despite being
able to do everything. On this side the result of repentance was as it
was. Now let us see the other side. When after crossing the border of
Hijaz, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr reached the place Aylah on the coast of the
Red Sea people caught sight of a camel rider who was making his camel
run so fast as though the enemy was chasing him. These people had some
misgivings about him and therefore called him and enquired who he was.
He said he was the slave of \`Uthman. They enquired wherefore he was
bound. He said Egypt. They enquired to whom he was going. He replied to
the Governor of Egypt. People said that the Governor of Egypt was with
them. To whom was he going then? He said he was to go to Ibn Abi Sarh.
People asked him if any letter was with him. He denied. They asked for
what purpose he was going. He said he did not know that. One of these
people thought that his clothes should be searched. So the search was
made, but nothing was found on him. Kinanah ibn Bishr at-Tujibi said,
"See his water-skin." People said, "Leave him, how can there be a letter
in water! Kinanah said, "You do not know what cunning these people play.
" Consequently, the water-skin was opened and seen. There was a lead
pipe in it wherein was a letter. When it was opened and read, the
Caliph's order in it was that "When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr and his party
reaches you then from among them kill so and so, arrest so and so, and
put so and so in jail, but you remain on your post." On reading this all
were stunned and thus began to look at one another in astonishment. A
Persian hemistich says: Mind was just burst in astonishment as to what
wonder it was! Now proceeding forward was riding into the mouth of
death, consequently they returned to Medina taking the slave with them.
Reaching there they placed that letter before all the companions of the
Prophet. Whoever heard this incident remained stunned with astonishment,
and there was no one who was not abusing \`Uthman. Afterwards a few
companions went to \`Uthman along with these people, and asked whose
seal was there on this letter. He replied that it was his own. They
enquired whose writing it was. He said it was his secretary's. They
enquired whose slave was that man. He replied that it was his. They
enquired whose riding beast it was. He replied that it was that of the
Government. They enquired who had sent it. He said he had no knowledge
of it. People then said, "Good Heavens. Everything is yours but you do
not know who had sent it. If you are so helpless, you leave this
Caliphate and get off from it so that such a man comes who can
administer the affairs of the Muslims." He replied, "It is not possible
that I should put off the dress of Caliphate which Allah has put on me.
Of course, I would offer repentance." The people said, "Why should you
speak of repentance which has already been flouted on the day when
Marwan was representing you on your door, and whatever was wanting has
been made up by this letter. Now we are not going to be duped into these
bluffs. Leave the Caliphate and if our brethren stand in our way we will
hold them up; but if they prepare for fighting we too will fight.
Neither our hands are stiff nor our swords blunt. If you regard all
Muslims equally and uphold justice hand over Marwan to us to enable us
to enquire from him on whose strength and support he wanted to play with
the precious lives of Muslims by writing this letter." But he rejected
this demand and refused to hand over Marwan to them, whereupon people
said that the letter had been written at his behest. However, improving
conditions again deteriorated and they ought to have deteriorated
because despite lapse of the required time everything was just as it had
been and not a jot of difference had occurred. Consequently, the people
who had stayed behind in the valley of Dhakhushub to watch the result of
repentance again advanced like a flood and spread over the streets of
Medina, and closing the borders from every side surrounded his house.
During these days of siege a companion of the Prophet, Niyar ibn \`Iyad
desired to talk to \`Uthman, went to his house and called him. When he
peeped out from the above he said, "O' \`Uthman, for Allah's sake give
up this Caliphate and save Muslims from this bloodshed." While he was
just conversing, one of \`Uthman's men aimed at him with an arrow and
killed him, whereupon people were infuriated and shouted that Niyar's
killer should be handed over to them. \`Uthman said it was not possible
that he would hand over his own support to them. This stubbornness
worked like a fan on fire and in the height of fury people set fire to
his door and began advancing for entering, when Marwan ibn al-Hakam,
Sa\`id ibn al-\`As and Mughirah ibn al-Akhnas together with their
contingents pounced upon the besiegers and killing and bloodshed started
at his door. People wanted to enter the house but they were being pushed
back. In the meanwhile, \`Amr ibn Hazm al-Ansari whose house was
adjacent to that of \`Uthman opened his door and shouted for advancing
from that side. Thus through this house the besiegers climbed on the
roof of \`Uthman's house and descending down from there drew their
swords. Only a few scuffles had taken place when all except people of
\`Uthman's house, his well-wishers and Banu Umayyah ran away in the
streets of Medina and a few hid themselves in the house of Umm Habibah
bint Abi Sufyan (Mu\`awiyah's sister) the rest were killed with \`Uthman
defending him to the last. (at-Tabaqat, Ibn Sa\`d, vol. 3, Part 1, pp.
50-58; at-Tabari, vol. 1, pp. 2998-3025; al-Kamil, Ibn al-Athir, vol. 3,
pp. 167-180; Ibn Abi'l-Hadid, vol. 2, pp. 144-161). At his killing
several poets wrote elegies. A couplet from the elegy by Abu Hurayrah is
presented: Today people have only one grief but I have two griefs - the
loss of my money bag and the killing of \`Uthman. After observing these
events the stand of Amir al-mu'minin becomes clear, namely that he was
neither supporting the group that was instigating at \`Uthman's killing
nor can be included in those who stood for his support and defence but
when he saw that what was said was not acted upon he kept himself aloof.
When both the parties are looked at then among the people who had raised
their hands off from \`Uthman's support are seen \`A'ishah, and
according to the popular versions (which is not right) the then living
persons out of the ten Pre-informed ones (who had been pre-informed in
this world by the Prophet for their being admitted in Paradise), out of
those who took part in the consultative committee (formed for \`Uthman's
selection for Caliphate), ansar, original muhajirun, people who took
part in the battle of Badr and other conspicuous and dignified
individuals, while on the side (of Uthman) are seen only a few slaves of
the Caliph and a few individuals from Banu Umayyah. If people like
Marwan and Sa\`id ibn al-\`As cannot be given precedence over the
original muhajirun their actions too cannot be given precedence over the
actions of the latter. Again, if ijma\` (consensus of opinion) is not
meant for particular occasions only then it would be difficult to
question this overwhelming unanimity of the companions.
