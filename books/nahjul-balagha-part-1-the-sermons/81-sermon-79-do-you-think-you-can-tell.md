Sermon 79: Do you think you can tell
====================================

*When* [^1]*Amir al-mu’minin decided to set out for the battle with the
Kharijites someone said, “If you set out at this moment then according
to astrology I fear you will not be successful in your aim,” whereupon
Amir al-mu’minin said:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لبعض أصحابه لمّا عزم على المسير إِلى الخوارج، فقال له: يا أميرالمؤمنين
إن سرت في هذا الوقت، خشيتُ ألاَّ تظفر بمرادك، من طريق علم النجوم، فقال
(عليه السلام):
  </p>
</blockquote>

Do you think you can tell the time when a man goes out and no evil
befall him or can warn of the time at which if one goes out harm will
accrue? Whoever testifies to this falsifies the Qur’an and becomes
unmindful of Allah in achieving his desired objective and in warding off
the undesirable. You cherish saying this so that he who acts on what you
say should praise you rather than Allah because according to your
misconception you have guided him about the hour in which he would
secure benefit and avoid harm.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَتَزْعَمُ أَنَّكَ تَهْدِي إِلَى السَّاعَةِ الَّتِي مَنْ سَارَ فِيهَا
صُرِفَ عَنْهُ السُّوءُ؟ وَتُخَوِّفُ مِنَ السَّاعَةِ الَّتي مَنْ سَارَ
فِيهَا حَاقَ بِهِ الضُّرُّ؟ فَمَنْ صَدَّقَكَ بِهذَا فَقَدْ كَذَّبَ
الْقُرْآنَ، وَاسْتَغْنَى عَنِ الاِسْتِعَانَةِ بِاللهِ عزّوجلّ فِي
نَيْلِ الْمحْبُوبِ وَدَفْعِ الْمَكْرُوهِ، وَتَبْتَغِي في قوْلِكَ
لِلْعَامِلِ بِأَمْرِكَ أَنْ يُولِيَكَ الْحَمْدَ دُونَ رَبِّهِ،
لاَِنَّكَ ـ بِزَعْمِكَ ـ أَنْتَ هَدَيْتَهُ إِلَى السَّاعَةِ الَّتِي
نَالَ فِيهَا النَّفْعَ، وَأَمِنَ الضُّرَّ!!
  </p>
</blockquote>

Then Amir al-mu’minin advanced towards the people and said:

O People! Beware of learning the science of stars except that with which
guidance is sought on land or sea, because it leads to divining and an
astrologer is a diviner, while the diviner is like the sorcerer, the
sorcerer is like the unbeliever and the unbeliever would be in Hell. Get
forward in the name of Allah.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إِيَّاكُمْ وَتَعَلُّمَ النُّجُومِ، إِلاَّ مَا
يُهْتَدَى بِهِ في بَرٍّ أَوْ بَحْر، فَإِنَّهَا تَدْعُو إِلَى
الْكَهَانَةِ، والمُنَجَّمُ كَالْكَاهِنِ، وَالْكَاهِنُ كَالسَّاحِرِ،
وَالسَّاحِرُ كَالْكَافِرِ! وَالْكَافِرُ في النَّارِ! سِيرُوا عَلَى
اسْمِ اللهِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

[^1]: When Amir al-mu'minin decided to march towards Nahrawan to
suppress the rising of the Kharijites, \`Afif ibn Qays al-Kindi said to
him, "This hour is not good. If you set out at this time. then instead
of victory and success you will face defeat and vanquishment." But Amir
al-mu'minin paid no heed to his view and ordered the army to march that
very moment. In the result the Kharijites suffered such a clear defeat
that out of their nine thousand combatants only nine individuals saved
their lives by running away while the rest were killed. Amir al-mu'minin
has argued about astrology being wrong or incorrect in three ways,
firstly, that if the view of an astrologer is accepted as correct it
would mean falsification of the Qur'an, because an astrologer claims to
ascertain hidden things of the future by seeing the stars while the
Qur'an says: Say: "None (either) in the heavens or in the earth knoweth
the unseen save Allah... " (27:65) Secondly that under his misconception
the astrologer believes that he can know his benefit or harm through
knowing the future. In that case he would be regardless of turning to
Allah and seeking His help, while this indifference towards Allah and
self-reliance is a sort of heresy and atheism, which puts an end to his
hope in Allah. Thirdly, that if he succeeds in any objective, he would
regard this success to be the result of his knowledge of astrology, as a
result of which he would praise himself rather than Allah, and will
expect that whomever he guides in this manner he too should be grateful
to him rather than to Allah . These points do not apply to astrology to
the extent it may be believed that the astrological findings are in the
nature of effect of medicines which are subject to alteration at the
will of Allah. The competence achieved by most of our religious scholars
in astrology is correct in this very ground that they did not regard its
findings as final.
