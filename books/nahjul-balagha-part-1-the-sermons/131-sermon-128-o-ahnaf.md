Sermon 128: O Ahnaf!....
========================

*About important future events in Basrah*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

O Ahnaf! It is as though I see him advancing with an army which has
neither dust nor noise, nor rustling of reins, nor neighing of horses.
They are trampling the ground with their feet as if they are the feet of
ostriches.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يَا أَحْنَفُ، كَأَنِّي بِهِ وَقَدْ سَارَ بِالْجَيْشِ الَّذِي لاَ
يَكُونُ لَهُ غُبَارٌ وَلاَ لَجَبٌ، وَلاَ قَعْقَعَةُ لُجُم، وَلاَ
حَمْحَمَةُ خَيْل، يُثِيرُونَ الاْرْضَ بِأَقْدَامِهِمْ كَأَنَّهَا
أَقْدَامُ النَّعَامِ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** Amir al-mu'minin pointed to the Chief of the
Negroes, (*Sahibu'z-Zanj*).[^1]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
يومىء بذلك (عليه السلام) إلى صاحب الزّنْج.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Then Amir al -mu'minin said:

Woe to you (the people of Basrah’s) inhabited streets and decorated
houses which possess wings like the wings of vultures and trunks like
the trunks of elephants; they are the people from among whom if one is
killed he is not mourned and if one is lost he is not searched for. I
turn this world over on its face, value it only according to its (low)
value, and look at it with an eye suitable to it.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ثمّ قال (عليه السلام): وَيْلٌ لِسِكَكِكُمُ الْعَامِرَةِ، وَدُورِكُمُ
الْمُزَخْرَفَةِ الَّتِي لَهَا أَجْنِحَةٌ كَأَجْنَحَةِ النُّسُورِ،
وَخَرَاطِيمُ كَخَرَاطِيمِ الْفِيَلَةِ، مِنْ أُولئِكَ الَّذِينَ لاَ
يُنْدَبُ قَتِيلُهُمْ، وَلاَ يُفْقَدُ غَائِبُهُمْ. أَنَا كَابُّ
الدُّنْيَا لِوَجْهِهَا، وَقَادِرُهَا بِقَدْرِهَا، وَنَاظِرُهَا
بِعَيْنِهَا.

I [^2] can see a people whose faces are like shields covered with
rough-scraped skins. They dress themselves in silken and woollen clothes
and hold dear excellent horses. Their killing and bloodshed shall take
place freely till the wounded shall walk over the dead and the number of
runners-away shall be less than those taken prisoner:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
كَأَنِّي أَرَاهُمْ قَوْماً كَأَنَّ وَجُوهَهُمُ الْـمَجَانُّ
الْمُطَرَّقَةُ، يَلْبَسُونَ السَّرَقَ وَالدِّيبَاجَ، وَيَعْتَقِبُونَ
الْخَيْلَ الْعِتَاقَ، وَيَكُونُ هُنَاكَ اسْتِحْرَارُ قَتْل،حَتَّى
يَمْشِيَ الْـمَجْرُوحُ عَلَى الْمَقْتُولِ، وَيَكُونَ الْمُفْلِتُ
أَقَلَّ مِنَ المَأْسُورِ!
  </p>
</blockquote>

**One of his companions said to him:** O Amir al-mu'minin, you have been
given knowledge of hidden things. Whereupon Amir al-mu'minin laughed and
said to the man who belonged to the tribe of Banu Kalb:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقال له بعض أصحابه: لقد أَعطيت يا أميرالمؤمنين علم الغيب! فضحك (عليه
السلام)، وقال للرجل ـ وكان كلبياً ـ :
  </p>
</blockquote>

O brother of Kalb! This is not knowledge of hidden things
(*\`ilmu'l-ghayb*), [^3] these matters have been acquired from him
(namely in Prophet) who knew them. As regard knowledge of hidden things,
that means knowledge of the Day of Judgement, and the things covered by
Allah in the verse:

**“*****Verily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour; He
sends down the rain, and He knows what is in the wombs. No soul knows
what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land it will
die..”*** **(Qur'an, 31:34)**

Therefore, Allah alone knows what is there in the wombs, whether male or
female, ugly or handsome, generous or miserly, mischievous or pious, and
who will be the fuel for Hell and who will be in the company of the
Prophets in Paradise. This is the knowledge of the hidden things which
is not known to anyone save Allah. All else is that whose knowledge
Allah passed on to His Prophet and he passed it on to me, and prayed for
me that my bosom may retain it and my ribs may hold it.

[^1]: \`Ali ibn Muhammad was born in the village of Warzanin in the
suburbs of Ray and belonged to the Azariqah sect of the Kharijites. He
claimed to be a sayyid (descendant of the Holy Prophet) by showing
himself the son of Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Mukhtafi ibn \`Isa ibn Zayd ibn
\`Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn \`Ali ibn Abi Talib, but the experts on
lineality and biographers have not accepted his claim to being a sayyid
and have given his father's name as Muhammad ibn \`Abd ar-Rahim instead
of Muhammad ibn Ahmad. The former was from the tribe of \`Abd al-Qays
and had been born of a Sindi maid-slave. \`Ali ibn Muhammad rose as an
insurgent in 255 A.H. in the reign of al-Muhtadi Billah and associated
with him the people from the suburbs of Basrah on promise of money,
wealth and freedom. He entered Basrah on the 17th Shuwwal, 255 A.H.
killing and looting, and in only two days he put to death thirty
thousand individuals, men, women and children, and displayed extreme
oppression, bloodshed, savageness and ferocity. He dismantled houses,
burnt mosques, and after continuous killing and devastation for fourteen
years, was killed in the month of Safar, 270 A.H. in the reign of
Muwaffaq Billah. Then people got rid of his devastating deeds. Amir
al-mu'minin's prophecy is one of those prophecies which throw light on
his knowledge of the unknown. The details of his army given by Amir
al-mu'minin namely that there would be neither neighing of horses nor
rustling of weapons therein is a historical fact. The historian
at-Tabari has written that when this man reached near al-Karkh (a sector
of Baghdad) with the intention of insurrection, the people of that place
welcomed him, and a man presented him a horse for which no rein could be
found despite a search. At last he rode it using a rope for the rein.
Similarly there were at that time only three swords in his force - one
with himself, one with \`Ali ibn Aban al-Muhallabi, and one with
Muhammad ibn Salm, but later they collected some more weapons by
marauding.

[^2]: This prophecy of Amir al-mu'minin is about the attack of the
Tartars (Mongols) who were inhabitants of the Mongolian desert in the
north west of Turkistan. These semi-savage tribes lived by marauding,
killing and devastating. They used to fight among themselves and attack
neighbouring areas. Each tribe had a separate chief who was deemed
responsible for their protection. Chingiz Khan (Temujin) who was one of
the ruling chiefs of these tribes and was very brave and courageous had
risen to organise all their divided tribes into one, and, despite their
opposition he succeeded in overpowering them through his might and
sagacity. Collecting a large number under his banner he rose in 606 A.H.
like a torrent and went on dominating cities and ruining populations
till he conquered the area upto North China. When his authority was
established he offered his terms of settlement to \`Alau'd-Din Khwarazm
Shah, ruler of the neighbouring country of Turkistan, and through a
deputation concluded an agreement with him that the Tartar traders would
be allowed to visit his country for trade and their life and property
would not be subject to any harm. For some time they traded freely
without fear but on one occasion \`Alau'd-Din accused them of spying,
seized their goods and had them killed by the Chief of Atrar. When
Chingiz Khan learnt of the breach of the agreement and the killing of
Tartar merchants his eyes cast forth flames and he began trembling with
rage. He sent word to \`Alau'd-Din to return the goods of the Tartar
merchants and to hand over to him the ruler of Atrar. \`Alau'd-Din, who
was mad with power and authority, did not pay any heed, and acting
short-sightedly killed even the plenipotentiary of Chingiz Khan. Now
Chingiz Khan lost all patience and his eyes filled with blood. He rose
with his sword in hand, and the Tartar warriors leapt towards Bukhara on
their speedy stallions. \`Alau'd-Din came out with four hundred thousand
combatants to face him but could not resist the incessant assaults of
the Tartars, and having been vanquished only after a few attacks ran
away to Nishabur across the river Jaxartes (Sihun). The Tartars smashed
Bukhara and razed it to the ground. They pulled down schools and
mosques, burning to ashes the houses and killing men and women without
distinction. Next year they assaulted Samarqand and devastated it
completely. After the flight of \`Alau'd-Din, his son Jalalu'd-Din
Khwarazm Shah had assumed the reins of government The Tartars chased him
also, and for ten years he fled from one place to the other but did not
fall in their hands. At last he crossed over the river out of the
boundaries of his realm. During this time the Tartars did their utmost
to ruin populated lands and to annihilate humanity. No city escaped
their ruining and no populace could avoid their trampling. Wherever they
went they upset the kingdom, overthrew governments, and in a short time
established their authority over the northern portion of Asia. When
Chingiz Khan died in 622 A.H. his own son Ogedei Khan succeeded him. He
searched out Jalalu'd-Din in 628 A.H. and killed him. After him Mongka
Khan, the son of the other son of Chingiz Khan, occupied the throne.
After Mongka Khan, Qubilai Khan succeeded to a part of the country and
the control of Asia fell to the share of his brother Hulagu Khan. On the
division of the whole realm among the grandsons of Chingiz Khan, Hulagu
Khan was thinking of conquering Muslims areas when the Hanafite of
Khurasan in enmity with the Shafi\`ite invited him to attack Khurasan.
He therefore led an assault on Khurasan, and the Hanafite, thinking
themselves to be safe from the Tartars, opened the city gates for them.
But the Tartars did not make any distinction between Hanafite and
Shafi\`ite and killed whoever fell to their hands. After killing most of
its population they took it in occupation. These very differences
between the Hanafite and the Shafi\`ite opened for him the door of
conquest upto Iraq. Consequently, after conquering Khurasan his courage
increased and in 656 A.H. he marched on Baghdad with two hundred
thousand Tartars. Al-Musta\`sim Billah's army and the people of Baghdad
jointly faced them, but it was not in their power to stop this torrent
of calamity. The result was that the Tartars entered Baghdad on the day
of \`Ashura' carrying with them bloodshed and ruin. They remained busy
in killing for forty days. Rivers of blood flowed in the streets and all
the alleys were filled with dead bodies. Hundred of thousands of people
were put to the sword while al-Musta\`sim Billah was trampled to death
under foot. Only those people who hid themselves in wells or underground
places and hid from their sight could survive. This was the devastation
of Baghdad which shook the \`Abbasid Kingdom to its foundation, so that
its flag could never fly thereafter. Some historians have laid the blame
of this ruin on Ibn al-\`Alqami (Abu Talib, Muhammad ibn Ahmad
al-Baghdadi), the minister of al-Musta\`sim Billah, by holding that,
moved by the general masses of the Shi\`ahs and the ruin of al-Karkh
sector (of Baghdad), he invited Hulagu Khan through the latter's
minister, the great scholar Nasiru'd-Din Muhammad ibn Muhammad at-Tusi,
to march on Baghdad. Even if it be so, it is not possible to ignore the
historical fact that before this the \`Abbasid Caliph an-Nasir
Lidini'llah had initiated the move for the attack on the Muslim areas.
When the Khwarazm Shahs declined to acknowledge the authority of the
Caliphate he had sent word to Chingiz Khan to march on Khwarazm, from
which the Tartars had understood that there was no unity and
co-operation among the Muslims. Thereafter the Hanafite had sent for
Hulagu Khan to crush the Shafi\`ite as a consequence of which the
Tartars secured control over Khurasan, and prepared the way to march
towards Baghdad. In these circumstances to hold only Ibn al-\`Alqami
responsible for the ruination of Baghdad and to ignore the move of
an-Nasir Lidini'llah and the dispute between the Hanafite and the
Shafi\`ite would be covering up the facts, when in fact the cause for
the ruin of Baghdad was this very conquest of Khurasan, whose real
movers were the Hanafite inhabitants of the place. It was by this
conquest that Hulagu Khan had the courage to march on the centre of
Islam; otherwise it cannot have been the result of a single individual's
message that he assaulted an old capital like Baghdad, the awe of whose
power and grandeur was seated in the hearts of a large part of the
world.

[^3]: To know hidden things on a personal level is one thing, while to
be gifted by Allah with knowledge of any matter and to convey it to
others is different. The knowledge of the future which the prophets and
vicegerents possess is gained by them through Allah's teaching and
informing. Allah alone has knowledge of events which are to happen in
the future. Of course, He passes this knowledge on to whoever He wills.
Thus He says: (He alone is) the "Knower of the unseen, neither doth He
reveal His secrets unto any (one else) save unto that one of the
Messengers whom He chooseth..." (Qur'an, 72:26-27) In this way Amir
al-mu'minin also received knowledge of the future through the
instructions of the Prophet or inspiration from Allah, for which these
words of Amir al-mu'minin stand evidence. Of course, sometimes it is not
proper or expedient to disclose certain matters and they are allowed to
remain under a veil. Then no one can be acquainted with them as Allah
says: Verily, Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour and He
sendeth down the rain, and knoweth He what is in the wombs; and knoweth
not any soul what he shall earn the morrow, and knoweth not any soul in
what lands he shall die: Verily Allah is All-knowing, All- aware.
(Qur'an, 31:34)
