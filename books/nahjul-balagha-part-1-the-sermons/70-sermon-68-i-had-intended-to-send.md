Sermon 68: I had intended to send ...
=====================================

*When Amir al-mu'minin appointed Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr*[^1] *Governor of
Egypt and he was overpowered and killed, Amir al-mu'minin said:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لمّا قلد محمّد بن أبي بكر مصر فملكت عليه وقتل
  </p>
</blockquote>

I had intended to send Hashim ibn \`Utbah to Egypt and had l done so he
would not have made way for the opponents nor given them time (to get
hold of him). This is without reproach to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr as I
loved him and had brought him up.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وَقَدْ أَرَدْتُ تَوْلِيَةَ مِصْرَ هَاشِمَ بْنَ عُتْبَةَ، وَلَوْ
وَلَّيْتُهُ إِيَّاهَا لَما خَلَّى لَهُمُ الْعَرْصَةَ، وَلاَ
أَنْهَزَهُمُ الْفُرْصَةَ، بَلاَ ذَمٍّ لِمحَمَّدِ بْنِ أَبي بَكْر،
فَلَقَدْ كَانَ إِلَيَّ حَبِيباً، وَكَانَ لي رَبِيباً.
  </p>

[^1]: Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr's mother was Asma' bint \`Umays whom Amir
al-mu'minin married after Abu Bakr's death. Consequently, Muhammad lived
and was brought up under the care of Amir al-mu'minin and he imbibed his
ways and manners. Amir al-mu'minin too loved him much and regarded him
as his son, and used to say "Muhammad is my son from Abu Bakr." He was
born in the journey for the last hajj (of the Prophet) and died as
martyr in 38 A.H. at the age of twenty eight years. On accession to the
Caliphate Amir al-mu'minin had selected Qays ibn Sa\`d ibn \`Ubadah as
the Governor of Egypt but circumstances so developed that he had to be
removed and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had to be sent there as Governor. The
policy of Qays there was that he did not want to take any serious step
against the \`Uthmani group but Muhammad's view was different. After the
lapse of a month he sent them word that in case they did not obey him
their existence there would be impossible. Upon this these people
organised a front against him, and engaged themselves in secret
wire-pullings, but became conspicuous soon. After arbitration they
started creating trouble with the slogan of vengeance. This polluted the
atmosphere of Egypt. When Amir al-mu'minin came to know these
deteriorated conditions he gave the governorship of Egypt to Malik ibn
al-Harith al-Ashtar and sent him off there in order that he might
suppress insurgent elements and save the administration from getting
worse, but he could not escape the evil designs of the Umayyads and was
killed by poison while on his way. Thus, the governorship of Egypt
remained with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. On this side, the performance of
\`Amr ibn al-\`As in connection with the Arbitration made Mu\`awiyah
recall his own promise. Consequently, he gave him six thousand
combatants and set him off to attack Egypt. When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
knew of the advancing force of the enemy he wrote to Amir al-mu'minin
for help. Amir al-mu'minin replied that he would be soon collecting help
for him but in the meantime he should mobilise his own forces. Muhammad
mobilised four thousand men under his banner and divided them into two
parts. He kept one part with himself and on the other he placed Kinanah
ibn Bishr at-Tujibi in command and ordered him to go forward to check
the enemy's advance. When they settled down in camp before the enemy
various parties of the enemy began attacking them but they faced them
with courage and valour. At last Mu\`awiyah ibn Hudayj as-Sakuni
al-Kindi made an assault with full force. These people did not turn away
from the enemy's swords but faced them steadfastly and fell as martyrs
in action. The effect of this defeat was that Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr's
men got frightened and deserted him. Finding himself alone Muhammad fled
away and sought refuge in a deserted place. The enemy however got news
about him through someone and traced him out when he was dying with
thirst. Muhammad asked for water but these cruel men refused and
butchered him thirsty. Then they put his body in the belly of a dead ass
and burnt it. Malik ibn Ka\`b al-Arhabi had already left Kufah with two
thousand men but before he could reach Egypt it had been occupied by the
enemy.
