Sermon 16: My word is the guarantee of my promise ...
=====================================================

*Delivered when allegiance was sworn to him at Medina*

The responsibility for what I say is guaranteed and I am answerable for
it. He to whom experiences have clearly shown the past exemplary
punishments (given by Allah to peoples) is prevented by piety from
falling into doubts. You should know that the same troubles have
returned to you which existed when the Prophet was first sent.

By Allah who sent the Prophet with faith and truth, you will be severely
subverted, bitterly shaken as in sieving and fully mixed as by spooning
in a cooking pot till your low persons become high and high ones become
low, those who were behind would attain forward positions and those who
were forward would become backward. By Allah, I have not concealed a
single word or spoken any lie and I had been informed of this event and
of this time.

  <p>
ذِمَّتي بِمَا أَقُولُ رَهِينَةٌ وَأَنَا بِهِ زَعِيمٌ : إِنَّ مَنْ
صَرَّحَتْ لَهُ العِبَرُ عَمَّا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ المَثُلاتِ،
حَجَزَهُ التَّقْوَى عَنْ تَقَحُّمِ الشُّبُهَاتِ. أَلاَ وَإِنَّ
بَلِيَّتَكُمْ قَدْ عَادَتْ كَهَيْئَتِهَا يَوْمَ بَعَثَ اللهُ نَبِيَّهُ
(صلى الله عليه وآله)، وَالَّذِي بَعَثَهُ بِالحَقِّ لَتُبَلْبَلُنَّ
بَلْبَلَةً، وَلَتُغَرْبَلُنَّ غَرْبَلَةً، وَلَتُسَاطُنَّ سَوْطَ
القِدْرِ، حَتَّى يَعُودَ أَسْفَلُكُمْ أَعْلاَكُمْ، وَأَعْلاَكُمْ
أَسْفَلَكُمْ، وَلَيَسْبِقَنَّ سَابِقُونَ كَانُوا قَصَّرُوا،
وَلَيُقَصِّرَنَّ سَبَّاقُونَ كَانُوا سَبَقُوا. وَاللهِ مَا كَتَمْتُ
وَشْمَةً، وَلا كَذَبْتُ كِذْبَةً، وَلَقَدْ نُبِّئْتُ بِهذا المَقامِ
وَهذَا اليَوْمِ.

Beware that sins are like unruly horses on whom their riders have been
placed and their reins have been let loose so that they would jump with
them in Hell. Beware that piety is like trained horses on whom the
riders have been placed with the reins in their hands, so that they
would take the riders to Heaven. There is right and wrong and there are
followers for each. If wrong dominates, it has (always) in the past been
so, and if truth goes down that too has often occurred. It seldom
happens that a thing that lags behind comes forward.

**ash-Sharif ar-Radi says:** In this small speech there is more beauty
than can be appreciated, and the quantity of amazement aroused by it is
more than the appreciation accorded to it. Despite what we have stated
it has so many aspects of eloquence that cannot be expressed nor can
anyone reach its depth, and no one can understand what I am saying
unless one has attained this art and known its details.

***No one appreciates it except those who know (Qur’an, 29:43)***

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال السيد الشريف: وأقول: إنّ في هذا الكلام الادنى من مواقع الاحسان ملا
تبلغه مواقع الاستحسان، وإنّ حظ العجب منه أكثر من حظ العُجب به، وفيه ـ
مع الحال التي وصفنا ـ زوائد من الفصاحة لا يقوم بها لسان، ولا يَطَّلع
فَجها إنسان، ولا يعرف ما أقوله إلاّ من ضرب في هذه الصناعة بحق، وجرى
فيها على عرق، (وَمَا يَعْقِلُهَا إلاّ العَالمِونَ).

He who has heaven and hell in his view has no other aim. He who attempts
and acts quickly, succeeds, while the seeker who is slow may also
entertain hope, and he who falls short of action faces destruction in
Hell. On right and left there are misleading paths. Only the middle way
is the (right) path which is the Everlasting Book and the traditions of
the Prophet. From it the *sunnah* has spread out and towards it is the
eventual return.

<blockquote dir="rtl">

شُغِلَ مَنِ الجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ أَمَامَهُ! سَاع سَرِيعٌ نَجَا،

He who claims (otherwise) is ruined and he who concocts falsehood is
disappointed. He who opposes[^1] right with his face gets destruction.
It is enough ignorance for a man not to know himself. He who is strong
rooted[^2] in piety does not get destruction, and the plantation of a
people based on piety never remains without water. Hide yourselves in
your houses and reform yourselves. Repentance is at your back. One
should praise only Allah and condemn only his own self.

[^1]: In some versions after the words "man abda safhatahu lilhaqqi
halaka:" the words "\`inda jahalati'n-nas" also occur. In that case the
meaning of this sentence would be that he who stands in face of right
dies in the estimation of the ignorant.

[^2]: Piety is the name of heart and mind being affected and impressed
by the Divine Greatness and Glory, as an effect of which the spirit of
man becomes full of fear of Allah, and its inevitable result is that
engrossment in worship and prayer increases. It is impossible that heart
may be full of Divine fear and there be no manifestation of it in
actions and deeds. And since worship and submission reform the heart and
nurture the spirit, purity of heart increases with the increase of
worship. That is why in the Qur'an "taqwa" (piety) has been applied
sometimes to fear, sometimes to worship and devotion and sometimes to
purity of heart and spirit. Thus in the verse "wa iyyaya fattaqun" (and
Me you fear [16:2]) taqwa implies fear, in the verse, "ittaqu'l-laha
haqqa tuqatihi" (worship Allah as He ought to be worshipped [3:102]),
taqwa implies worship and devotion and in the verse "wa yakhsha'l-laha
wa yattaqhi faulaika humu'l-faizun" (24:52) taqwa implies purity of
spirit and cleanliness of heart. In the traditions taqwa has been
assigned three degrees. The first degree is that a man should follow the
injunctions and keep aloof from prohibitions. The second degree is that
recommended matters should also be followed and disliked things should
be avoided. The third degree is that for fear of falling into doubts one
may abstain from the permissible as well. The first degree is for the
common men, the second for the nobles and the third for high
dignitaries. Allah has referred to these three degrees in the following
verse: On those who believe and do good, is no blame for what they ate,
(before) when they did guard themselves and did believe, and did good,
still (furthermore) they guard themselves and do good; and Allah loveth
the doers of good. (Qur'an, 5:93) Amir al-mu'minin says that only action
based on piety is lasting, and only that action will blossom and bear
fruit which is watered by piety because worship is only that wherein the
feeling of submission exists. Thus, Allah says: Is he therefore better
who hath laid his foundation on fear of Allah and (His) goodwill or he
who layeth his foundation on the brink of a crumbling hollowed bank so
it crumbled down with him into the fire of Hell... (Qur'an, 9:109)
Consequently, every such belief as is not based on knowledge and
conviction is like the edifice, erected without foundation, wherein
there is no stability or firmness while every action that is without
piety is like the plantation which withers for lack of watering.
