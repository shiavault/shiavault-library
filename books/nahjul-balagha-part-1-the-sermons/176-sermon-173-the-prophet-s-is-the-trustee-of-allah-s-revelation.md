On eligibility for the Caliphate

The Prophet (S) is the trustee of Allah's revelation, the Last of His
Prophets. the giver of tidings of His mercy and the warner for His
chastisement.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
أَمِينُ وَحْيِهِ، وَخَاتَمُ رُسُلِهِ، وَبَشِيرُ رَحْمَتِهِ، وَنَذِيرُ
نِقْمَتِهِ.

O people! The most rightful of all persons for this matter (namely the
caliphate) is he who is most competent among them to maintain it, and he
who knows best Allah's commands about it. If any mischief is created by
a mischief-monger, he will be called upon to repent. If he refuses, he
will be fought.

By my life, [^1] if the question of Imamah was not to be decided unless
all the people were present, then there would be no such case. But those
who agreed about it imposed the decision on those who were absent, so
much so that he who was present could not dissent and the one who was
absent could not choose (any one else). Know that I shall fight two
persons - one who claims what is not his and the other who ignores what
is obligatory upon him.

وَآخَرَ مَنَعَ الَّذِي عَلَيْهِ.

The need for sagacity in fighting against Muslims
-------------------------------------------------

O creatures of Allah! I advise you to have fear of Allah because it is
the best advice to be mutually given by persons, and the best of all
things before Allah. The door of war has been opened between you and the
other Muslims. And this banner will be borne only by him who is a man of
sight, of endurance and of knowledge of the position of rightfulness.
Therefore, you should go ahead with what you are ordered and desist from
what you are refrained. Do not make haste in any matter till you have
clarified it. For in the case of every matter which you dislike we have
a right to change it.

أُوصِيكُمْ عياد اللهِ بَتَقْوَى اللهِ، فَإنَّهـ [ا] خَيْرُ مَا
تَوَاصَى الْعِبَادُ بِهِ، وَخَيْرُ عَوَاقِبِ الاْمُورِ عِنْدَ اللهِ،
وَقَدْ فُتِحَ بَابُ الْحَرْبِ بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ أَهْلِ الْقِبْلَةِ،
وَلاَ يَحْمِلُ هذَا الْعَلَمَ إِلاَّ أَهْلُ الْبَصَرِ والصَّبْرِ
وَالْعِلْمِ بِمَوَاضِعِ الْحَقِّ، فَامْضُوا لِمَا تُؤْمَرُونَ بِهِ،
وَقِفُوا عِنْدَ مَا تُنْهَوْنَ عَنْهُ، وَلاَ تَعْجَلُوا فِي أَمْر
حَتَّى تَتَبَيَّنُوا، فَإِنَّ لَنَا مَعَ كُلِّ أَمْر تُنْكِرُونَهُ
غِيَراً

The behaviour of this world with its adherents
----------------------------------------------

<blockquote dir="rtl">

هوان الدنيا
  </p>
</blockquote>

Know that this world which you have started to covet and in which you
are interested, and which sometimes enrages you and sometimes pleases
you is not your (permanent) abode, nor the place of your stay for which
you might have been created, nor one to which you have been invited.
Know that it will not last for you nor will you live along with it. If
anything out of this world deceives you (into attraction), its evils
warn you too.

You should give up (the objects of) its deceits in favour of (the
objects of) its warning and (the objects of) its attractions in favour
of (the objects of) its terrors. And while here in it, advance towards
that house to which you have been called, and turn away your hearts from
the world. None of you should cry like a maid slave over anything which
she has been deprived of. Seek the perfection of Allah's bounty over you
by endurance in obedience to Allah and in guarding what He has asked you
to guard, namely His Book.

Know that the loss of anything of this world will not harm you, if you
have guarded the principles of your religion. Know also that after the
loss of your religion nothing of this world for which you have cared
will benefit you. May Allah carry our hearts and your hearts towards the
right and may He grant us and you endurance.

Alternative Sources for Sermon 173
----------------------------------

(1) Al-Harrani, *Tuhaf,* 130;

(2) Abu Ja\`far al-'Iskafi, *Naqd al-\`Uthmaniyyah,* see Ibn Abi
al-Hadid, II, 171-173.

[^1]: When the people collected in the Saqifah of Banu Sa\`idah in
connection with the election, even those who were not present there were
made to follow the decision taken there, and the principle was adopted
that those present at the election had no right to reconsider the matter
or to break the allegiance and those not present could do nothing but
acquiesce in the agreed decision. But when the people of Medina swore
allegiance at the hands of Amir al-mu'minin, the Governor of Syria
(Mu\`awiyah) refused to follow suit on the ground that since he was not
present on the occasion he was not bound to abide by it, whereupon Amir
al-mu'minin gave a reply in this sermon on the basis of these accepted
and agreed principles and conditions which had been established among
these people and had become incontrovertible namely that: "When the
people of Medina and the ansar and the muhajirun have sworn allegiance
on my hand, Mu\`awiyah had no right to keep aloof from it on the ground
that he was not present on the occasions nor were Talhah and az-Zubayr
entitled to break the pledge after swearing allegiance." On this
occasion, Amir al-mu'minin did not argue on the strength of any saying
of the Prophet which would serve as his final say about the caliphate,
because the grounds for refusal in his case was in respect of the modus
operandi of the principle of election. Therefore, in keeping with the
requirements of the situation a reply based on the agreed principles of
the adversary could alone quieten him. Even if he had argued on the
strength of the Prophet's command it would have been subjected to
various interpretations and the matter would have been prolonged instead
of being settled. Again Amir al-mu'minin had seen that soon after the
death of the Prophet all his sayings and commands had been set aside.
Therefore, how after the lapse of a long time, could one be expected to
accept it when habit had been established to follow one's free will
against the Prophet's sayings.
