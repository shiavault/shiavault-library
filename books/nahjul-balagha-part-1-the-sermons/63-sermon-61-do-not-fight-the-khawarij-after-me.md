Sermon 61: Do not fight the Khawarij after me ...
=================================================

*Amir al-mu'minin also said concerning the Kharijites:*

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقال (عليه السلام) فيهم
  </p>
</blockquote>

Do not fight[^1] the Kharijites after me, because one who seeks right
but does not find it, is not like one who seeks wrong and finds it.

**As-Sayyid ar-Radi says:** (By “one who seeks wrong and finds it”) Amir
al-mu'minin means Mu\`awiyah and his men.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
لاَ تَقْتُلُوا الْخَوَارِجَ بَعْدِي، فَلَيْسَ مَنْ طَلَبَ الْحَقَّ
فَأَخْطَأَهُ، كَمَنْ طَلَبَ الْبَاطِلَ فَأَدْرَكَهُ.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
قال السيد الشريف: يعني معاوية وأصحابه.
  </p>
</blockquote>

[^1]: The reason for stopping people from fighting the Kharijites was
that Amir al-mu'minin was clearly perceiving that after him authority
and power would devolve on people who would be ignorant of the proper
occasion of jihad, and who will make use of sword only to maintain their
sway. And there were those who excelled even Kharijites in holding and
calling Amir al-mu'minin bad. So those who are themselves in the wrong
have no right to fight others in the wrong. Again, those who are
wilfully in the wrong can be allowed to fight those who are in the wrong
by mistake. Thus, Amir al-mu'minin's words make this fact clear that the
misguidance of Kharijites was not wilful but under Satan's influence.
They mistook wrong as right and stuck to it. On the other hand, the
position of misguidance of Mu\`awiyah and his party was that they
rejected right realising it as right and appropriated wrong as the code
of their conduct fully knowing that it was wrong. Their audacity in the
matter of religion reached the stage that it can neither be regarded as
a result of misunderstanding nor can it be covered under the garb of
error of judgement, because they openly transgressed the limits of
religion and paid no heed to the Prophet's injunctions in comparison
with their own view. Thus, Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written (vol. 5, p. 130)
that when the Prophet's companion Abu'd-Darda' saw utensils of gold and
silver being used by Mu\`awiyah he said he had heard the Prophet saying,
"One who drinks in vessels of gold and silver will feel flames of the
fire of Hell in his stomach" whereupon Mu\`awiyah said, "As for me, l do
not find any harm in it." Similarly, creating Ziyad ibn Abih's blood
relationship with himself by his own opinion in total disregard of the
Prophet's injunction, abusing the descendants of the Prophet over the
pulpit, transgressing the limits of shari\`ah, shedding blood of
innocent persons and placing over Muslims (as so called Khalifah) a
vicious individual and thus opening the way to disbelief and atheism are
events that to attribute them to any misunderstanding is like wilfully
closing eyes to facts.
