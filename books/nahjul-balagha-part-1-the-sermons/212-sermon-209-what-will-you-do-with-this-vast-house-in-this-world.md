Sermon 209: What will you do with this vast house in this world…
================================================================

Amir al-mu'minin went to enquire about the health of his companion
al-\`Ala' ibn Ziyad al-Harithi and when he noticed the vastness of his
house he said:

  <p>
ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)
  </p>

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
بالبصرة، وقد دخل على العلاء بن زياد الحارثي ـ وهو من أصحابه ـ يعوده،
فلما رأى سعة داره قال:
  </p>
</blockquote>

What will you do with this vast house in this world, although you need
this house more in the next world. If you want to take it to the next
world you could entertain in it guests and be regardful of kinship and
discharge all (your) obligations according to their accrual. In this way
you will be able to take it to the next world.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
مَا كُنْتَ تَصْنَعُ بِسِعَةِ هذِهِ الدارِ فِي الدُّنْيَا، أَنْتَ
إِلَيْهَا فِي الاْخِرَةِ كُنْتَ أَحْوَجَ؟ وَبَلَى إِنْ شِئْتَ بَلَغْتَ
بِهَا الاْخِرَةَ، تَقْرِي فِيهَا الضَّيْفَ، وَتَصِلُ فِيهَا الرَّحِمَ،
وَتُطْلِعُ مِنْهَا الْحُقُوقَ مَطَالِعَهَا، فَإذَا أَنْتَ قَدْ
بَلَغْتَ بِهَا الاْخِرَةَ.
  </p>

**Then al-\`Ala' said to him:** O' Amir al-mu'minin, I want to complain
to you about my brother \`Asim ibn Ziyad.

**Amir al-mu'minin enquired:** What is the matter with him?

**al-\`Ala' said:** He has put on a woollen coat and cut himself away
from the world.

Amir al-mu'minin said: Present him to me.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
فقال له العلاء: يا أميرالمؤمنين، أشكو إليك أخي عاصم بن زياد. قال: وما
له؟ قال: لبس العباءة وتخلّى من الدنيا. قال: عليَّ به.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**When he came Amir al-mu'minin said:** O enemy of yourself. Certainly,
the evil (Satan) has misguided you. Do you feel no pity for your wife
and your children? Do you believe that if you use those things which
Allah has made lawful for you, He will dislike you? You are too
unimportant for Allah to do so.

**He said:** O Amir al-mu'minin, you also put on coarse dress and eat
rough food.

**Then he replied:** Woe be to you, I am not like you. Certainly, Allah,
the Sublime, has made it obligatory on true leaders that they should
maintain themselves at the level of low people so that the poor do not
cry over their poverty. [^1]

[^1]: From ancient days asceticism and the abandonment of worldly
attachments has been regarded as a means of purification of the spirit
and important for the character. Consequently, those who wished to lead
a life of abstemiousness and meditation used to go out of the cities and
towns to stay in forests and caves in the mountains and stay there
concentrating on Allah according to their own conception. They would eat
only if a casual traveller or the inhabitant of nearby dwellings gave
them anything to eat, otherwise they remained contented with the fruits
of wild trees and the water of the streams, and thus they passed their
life. This way of worship commenced in a way that was forced by the
oppression and hardships of rulers. Certain people left their houses
and, in order to avoid their grip, hid themselves in some wilderness or
cave in a mountain, engaging themselves in worship of and devotion to
Allah. Later on, this forced asceticism acquired a voluntary form and
people began to retire to caves and hollows of their own volition. Thus
it became an accepted way that whoever aimed at spiritual development
retired to some corner after severing himself from all worldly ties.
This method remained in vogue for centuries and even now some traces of
this way of worship are found among the Buddhists and the Christians.
The moderate views of Islam do not, however, accord with the monastic
life, because for attaining spiritual development it does not advocate
the abandonment of worldly enjoyments and successes, nor does it view
with approbation that a Muslim should leave his house and fellow men and
busy himself in formal worship, hiding in some corner. The conception of
worship in Islam is not confined to a few particular rites, but it
regards the earning of one's livelihood through lawful means, mutual
sympathy and good behaviour, and co-operation and assistance also to be
important constituents of worship. If an individual ignores worldly
rights and obligations and does not fulfil his responsibility towards
his wife and children, nor occupies himself in efforts to earn a
livelihood, but all the time stays in meditation, he ruins his life and
does not fulfil the purpose of living. If this were Allah's aim, what
would have the need for creating and populating the world when there was
already a category of creatures who were all the time engaged in
worshipping and adoration. Nature has made man to stand on the
cross-roads at which the midway is the centre of guidance. If he
deviates from this point of moderateness even a bit, this way or that
way, there is shear misguidance for him. That midway is that he should
neither bend towards this world to such an extent as to ignore the next
life, devoting himself entirely to this one, nor should he abstain from
this world so as not to have any connection with anything of it,
confining himself to some corner leaving everything else. Since Allah
has created man in this world he should follow the code of life for
living in this world, and should partake of the comforts and pleasures
bestowed by Allah within moderate limits. The eating and using of things
made lawful by Allah is not against Allah's worship, but rather Allah
has created these things for the very purpose that they should be taken
advantage of. That is why those who were the chosen of Allah lived in
this world with others and ate and drank like others. They did not feel
the need to turn their faces away from the people of the world, and to
adopt the wilderness or the caves of mountains as their abodes, or to
live in distant spots. On the other hand they remembered Allah, remained
disentangled from worldly affairs, and did not forget death despite the
pleasures and comforts of life. The life of asceticism sometimes
produces such evils as ruin the next life also as well as this one, and
such an individual proves to be the true picture of "the looser in this
life as well as the next." When natural impulses are not satisfied in
the lawful and legal way the mind turns into a centre of evil-ideas and
becomes incapable of performing worship with peace and concentration;
and sometimes passions so overcome the ascetic that breaking all moral
fetters, he devotes himself completely to their satisfaction and
consequently falls in an abyss of ruin for which it is impossible to
extract himself. That is why religious law accords a greater position to
the worship performed by a family man than that by a non-family man,
because the former can exercise mental peace and concentration in the
worship and rituals. Individuals who put on the cloak of Sufism and make
a loud show of their spiritual greatness are cut off from the path of
Islam and are ignorant of its wide teachings. They have been misled by
Satan and, relying on their self-formed conceptions, tread wrongful
paths. Eventually their misguidance becomes so serious that they begin
to regard their leaders as having attained such a level that their word
is as the word of Allah and their act is as the act of Allah. Sometimes
they regard themselves beyond all the bounds and limitations of
religious law and consider every evil act to be lawful for them. This
deviation from faith and irreligiousness is named Sufism (complete
devotion to Allah). Its unlawful principles are called "at-tariqah"
(ways of achieving communion with Allah) and the followers of this cult
are known as Sufis. First of all Abu Hashim al-Kufi and Shami adopted
this nickname. He was of Umayyad descent and a fatalist (believing that
man is bound to act as pre-ordained by Allah). The reason for giving him
this name was that, in order to make a show of his asceticism and fear
for Allah, he put on a woollen cloak. Later on this nickname became
common and various grounds were put forth as the basis of this name. For
example, one ground is that 'Sufi' has three letters, "sad", "waw" and
"fa'". "sad" stands for "sabr" (endurance), "sidq" (truthfulness) and
"safa" (purity of heart); "waw" stands for "wudd" (love), "wird"
(repeating Allah's name) and "wafa'" (faithfulness to Allah), and "fa'"
stands for "fard" (unity), "faqr" (destitution) and "fana'" (death or
absorption in Allah's Self). The second view is that it has been derived
from "as-Suffah", which was a platform near the Prophet's mosque which
had a covering of date-palm leaves. Those who stayed there were called
Ashabu'Suffah (people of the platform). The third view is that the name
of the progenitor of an Arab tribe was Sufah, and this tribe performed
the duties of serving the pilgrims and the Ka\`bah, and it is with
reference to their connection with this tribe that these people were
called Sufis. This group is divided among various sects but the basic
sects are seven only. 1) al-Wahdatiyyah (unitarian): This sect believes
in the oneness of all existence. Its belief is that everything of this
world is Allah, so much so that they assign to even polluted things the
same godly position. They liken Allah with the river and the waves
rising in it, and argue that the waves which sometimes rise and
sometimes fall have no separate existence other than the river, but
their existence is exactly the existence of the river. Therefore,
nothing can be separated from its own existence. 2) al-Ittihadiyyah (the
unitists): They believe that they have united with Allah and Allah has
united with them. They liken Allah with fire and themselves with iron
that lies in the fire and acquires its form and property. 3)
al-Hululiyyah (the formists): Their belief is that Allah takes the form
of those who claim to know Him and the perfect ones, and their bodies
are places of His stay. In this way, they are seemingly men but really
Allah. 4) al-Wasiliyyah (the combiners): This sect considers itself to
have combined with Allah. Their belief is that the laws of the shari\`ah
are a means of development of human personality and character, and that
when the human self combines with Allah it no more needs perfection or
development. Consequently, for the "wasilin", worship and ritual become
useless, because they hold that when truth and reality is achieved
shari\`ah remains of no avail. Therefore, they can do anything and they
cannot be questioned. 5) az-Zarraqiyyah (the revellers): This sect
regards vocal and instrumental music as worship, and earns the pleasures
of this world through a show of asceticism and begging from door to
door. They are ever engaged in relating concocted stories of miraculous
performances of their leaders to over-awe the common people. 6)
al-\`Ushshaqiyyah (the lovers): The theory of this sect is that
apparency is the means to reality, meaning that carnal love is the means
to achieve love of Allah. That is, in order to reach the stage of
Allah's love it is necessary to have love with some human beauty. But
the love which they regard as love for Allah is just the product of
mental disorder through which the lover inclines to one individual with
all his attention and his final aim is to have access to the beloved.
This love can lead to the way of evil and vice, but it has no connection
with the love of Allah. A Persian couplet says: The truth of the fact is
that carnal love is like a jinn and a jinn cannot give you guidance. 7)
at-Talqiniyyah (the encounterers): According to this sect, the reading
of religious sciences and books of scholarship is thoroughly unlawful.
Rather, the position that is achieved by an hour of spiritual effort of
the Sufis cannot be achieved by seventy years of reading books.
According to Shi\`ah \`Ulama' all these sects are on the wrong path and
out of the fold of Islam. In this connection, numerous sayings of the
Imams are related. In this sermon also Amir al-mu'minin has regarded the
severance of \`Asim ibn Ziyad from this world as the mischief of Satan,
and he forcefully dissuaded him from adopting that course. (For further
