Sermon 233: They differ among themselves…..
===========================================

*Causes for difference in the features and traits of people*

Dhi\`lib al-Yamami has related from Ahmad ibn Qutaybah, and he from
\`Abdullah ibn Yazid and he from Malik ibn Dihyah who said, "We were
with Amir al-mu'minin when discussion arose about the differences of men
(in features and conduct) and then Amir al-mu'minin said":

They differ among themselves because of the sources [^1] of their clay
(from which they have been created). This is because they are either
from saltish soil or sweet soil or from rugged earth or soft earth.
They, resemble each other on the basis of the affinity of their soil and
differ according to its difference. Therefore, sometimes a person of
handsome features is weak in intelligence, a tall statured person is of
low courage, a virtuous person is ugly in appearance, a short statured
person is far-sighted, a good-natured person has an evil trait, a person
of perplexed heart has bewildering mind and a sharp-tongued person has a
wakeful heart.

[^1]: Amir al-mu'minin has ascribed the differences in features and
characters of people to the differences in the clay from which they are
created and according to which their features are shaped and the
skeletons of their characters are formed. Therefore, to the extent that
their clay of origin is akin, their mental and imaginative tendencies
too will be similar and to the extent by which they differ, there will
be a difference in their inclinations and tendencies. By origins of a
thing are meant those things on which its coming into existence depends,
but they should not be its cause. The word "tin" is the plural of
"tinah" which means origin or basis. Here "tinah" means semen which
after passing through various stages of development emerges in the human
shape. Its origin means those constituents from which those items are
created which help in the formation of semen. Thus, by saltish, sweet,
soft or hard soil the reference is to these elementary constituents.
Since those elementary constituents carry different properties the semen
growing out of them will also bear different characteristics and
propensities which will (eventually) show forth in the differences in
features and conduct of those borne in it. Ibn Abi'l-Hadid has written
(in Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 13, p. 19) that "origins of tinah"
implies those preservative factors which are different in their
properties as Plato and other philosophers have held. The reason for
calling them "origins of tinah" is that they serve as an asylum for the
human body and prevent the elements from diffusion. Just as the
existence of a thing hinges on its basis, in the same way the existence
of this body which is made up of elements depends on preservative
factors. So long as the preservative factor exists the body is also safe
from disruption and disintegration and the elements too are immune to
diffusion and dispersal. When it leaves the body the elements also get
dispersed. According to this explanation Amir al-mu'minin's words would
mean that Allah has created different original factors among whom some
are vicious and some are virtuous, some are weak and some are strong,
and every person will act according to his original factor. If there is
similarity in the inclinations of two persons it is because their
original factor are similar, and if their tendencies differ it is
because their original factors do not have any similarity. But this
conclusion is not correct because Amir al-mu'minin's words do not only
refer to differences in conduct and behaviour but also of features and
shape and the differences of features and shape cannot be the result of
differences in original factors. In any case, whether the original
factors are the cause of differences in features and conduct or the
elementary constituents are the cause, these words appear to lead to the
negation of volition and to prove the compulsion (of destiny) in human
actions, because if man's capacity for thinking and acting is dependent
on "tinah" then he would be compelled to behave himself in a fixed way
on account of which he would neither deserve praise for good acts nor be
held blame worthy for bad habits. But this hypothesis is incorrect
because it is well established that just as Allah knows everything in
creation after its coming into being, in the same way He knew it before
its creation. Thus, He knew what actions man would perform of his free
will and what he would leave. Therefore, Allah gave him capacity to act
according to his free will, and created him from a suitable "tinah".
This tinah is not the cause of his actions so as to snatch away from him
his free will but the meaning of creating from suitable tinah is that
Allah does not by force stand in man's way but allows him to tread the
path he wants to tread of his own free will.
