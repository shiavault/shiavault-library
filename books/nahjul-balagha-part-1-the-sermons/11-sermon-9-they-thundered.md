Sermon 9: They thundered ...
============================

*Cowardice of the people of Jamal*

ومن كلام له (عليه السلام)

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
في صفته وصفة خصومه ويقال إنّها في أصحاب الجمل
  </p>
</blockquote>

They[^1] thundered like clouds and shone like lightning but despite both
these things they exhibited cowardice, while we do not thunder until we
pounce upon the foe nor do we show flow (of words) until we have not
virtually rained.

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
وقَدْ أَرْعَدُوا وَأبْرَقُوا، وَمَعَ هذَيْنِ الاْمْرَيْنِ الفَشَلُ،
وَلَسْنَا نُرْعِدُ حَتَّى نُوقِعَ، وَلا نُسِيلُ حَتَّى نُمْطِر .
  </p>

[^1]: About the people of Jamal (i.e. the enemy in the battle of Jamal)
Amir al-mu'minin says that they rose thundering, shouting and stampeding
but when encounter took place they were seen flying like straw. At one
time they made loud claims that they would do this and would do that and
now they showed such cowardice as to flee from the battle-field. About
himself Amir al-mu'minin says, that "We do not threaten the enemy before
battle, nor utter boasts, nor terrorise the enemy by raising unnecessary
cries because it is not the way of the brave to use the tongue instead
of the hand." That is why on this occasion he said to his comrades:
"Beware of excessive talk as it is cowardice."
