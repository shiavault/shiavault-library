Allah has taken upon Himself for the followers of this religion the
strengthening of boundaries and hiding of the secret places. Allah
helped them when they were few and could not protect themselves. He is
Living and will not die. If you will your self proceed towards the enemy
and clash with them and fall into some trouble, there will be no place
of refuge for the Muslims other than their remote cities, nor any place
they would return to. Therefore, you should send there an experienced
man and send with him people of good performance who are
well-intentioned. If Allah grants you victory, then this is what you
want. If it is otherwise, you would serve as a support for the people
and a returning place for the Muslims.

وَقَدْ تَوَكَّلَ اللهُ لاِهْلِ هَذا الدِّينِ بِإِعْزَازِ الْحَوْزَةِ،
وَسَتْرِ الْعَوْرَةِ، وَالَّذِي نَصَرَهُمْ وَهُمْ قَلِيلٌ لاَ
يَنْتَصِرُونَ، وَمَنَعَهُمْ وَهُمْ قَلِيلٌ لاَ يَمتَنِعُونَ، حَيٌّ لاَ
يَمُوتُ. إِنَّكَ مَتَى تَسِرْ إِلَى هذَا الْعَدُوِّ بِنَفْسِكَ،
فَتَلْقَهُمْ بِشَخْصِكَ فَتُنْكَبْ، لاَ تَكُنْ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ
كَانِفَةٌ دُونَ أَقْصَى بِلاَدِهِمْ، وَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ مَرْجِعٌ
يَرْجِعُونَ إِلَيْهِ، فَابْعَثْ إِلَيْهِمْ رَجُلاً مِحْرَباً،
وَاحْفِزْ مَعَهُ أَهْلَ الْبَلاَءِ وَالنَّصِيحَةِ، فَإِنْ أَظْهَرَ
اللهُ فَذَاكَ مَا تُحِبُّ، وَإِنْ تَكُنِ الاْخْرَى، كُنْتَ رِدْءاً
للنَّاسِ وَمَثَابَةً لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ.

[^1]: About Amir al-mu'minin, the strange position is adopted that on
the one hand, it is said that he was ignorant of practical politics and
unacquainted with ways of administration from which it is intended that
the revolts created by the Umayyad's lust for power should be shown to
be the outcome of Amir al-mu'minin's weak administration. On the other
hand, much is made of the various occasions when the then Caliphs
consulted Amir al-mu'minin in important affairs of State in the matter
of wars with unbelievers. The aim in this is not to exhibit his
correctness of thinking and judgement or deep sagacity but to show that
there was unity and concord between him and the Caliphs so that
attention should not be paid to the fact that in some matters they also
differed and that mutual clashes had also occurred. History shows that
Amir al-mu'minin did have differences of principles with the Caliphs and
did not approve every step of theirs. In the sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyyah
he has expressed in loud words his difference of opinion and anger about
each regime. Nevertheless, this difference does not mean that correct
guidance should be withheld in collective Islamic problems. Again, Amir
al-mu'minin's character was so high that no one could imagine that he
would ever evade giving counsel which concerned the common weal, or
would give such counsel which would damage public interests. That is
why, despite differences of principle, he was consulted. This throws
light on the greatness of his character and the correctness of his
thinking and judgement. Similarly, it is a prominent trait of the Holy
Prophet's character that despite rejecting his claim to prophethood the
unbelievers acknowledged him the best trustee and could never doubt his
trustworthiness. Rather, even during clashes of mutual opposition they
entrusted to him their property without fear and never suspected that
their property would be misappropriated. Similarly, Amir al-mu'minin was
held to occupy so high a position of trust and confidence that friend
and foe both trusted in the correctness of his counsel. So, just as the
Prophet's conduct shows his height of trustworthiness, and just as it
cannot be inferred from it that there was mutual accord between him and
the unbelievers, because trust has its own place while the clash of
Islam and unbelief has another, in the same way, despite having
differences with the Caliphs, Amir al-mu'minin was regarded as the
protector of national and community interests and as the guardian of
Islam's wellbeing and prosperity. Thus when national interests were
involved he was consulted and he tendered his unbiased advice raising
himself above personal ends and keeping in view the Prophet's tradition
to the effect that "He who is consulted is a trustee" never allowed any
dishonesty or duplicity to interfere. When on the occasion of the battle
of Palestine, the Caliph \`Umar consulted him about his taking part in
it himself, then, irrespective of whether or not his opinion would
accord with \`Umar's feelings, he kept in view Islam's prestige and
existence and counselled him to stay in his place and to send to the
battlefront such a man who should be experienced and wellversed in the
art of fighting, because the going of an inexperienced man would have
damaged the established prestige of Islam and the awe in which the
Muslims were held which had existed from the Prophet's days would have
vanished. In fact, in the Caliph \`Umar's going there Amir al-mu'minin
saw signs of defeat and vanquishment. He therefore found Islam's
interest to lie in detaining him and indicated his view in the words
that: "If you have to retreat from the battlefield, it would not be your
personal defeat only, but the Muslims would lose heart by it and leave
the battle-field and disperse here and there, because with the officer
in command leaving the field the army too would lose ground.
Furthermore, with the centre being without the Caliph there would be no
hope of any further assistance from behind which could sustain courage
of the combatants." This is that counsel which is put forth as a proof
of mutual accord although this advice was tendered in view of Islam's
prestige and life which was dearer to Amir al-mu'minin than any other
interest. No particular individual's life was dear to him for which he
might have advised against participation in the battle.
