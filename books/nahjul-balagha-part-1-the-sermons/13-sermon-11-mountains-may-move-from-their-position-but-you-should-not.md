Sermon 11: Mountains may move from their position, but you should not...
========================================================================

*Delivered in the Battle of Jamal when Amir al-mu’minin gave thestandard
to his son Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyah*[^1] may move from their position,
but you should not move from yours. Grit your teeth. Lend to Allah your
head (in fighting for Allah, give yourself to Allah). Plant your feet
firmly on the ground. Have your eye on the remotest foe and close your
eyes (to their numerical majority). And keep sure that succour is but
from Allah, the Glorified.

[^1]: Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah was Amir al-mu'minin's son but called
Ibn Hanafiyyah after his mother. His mother's name was Khawlah bint
Ja\`far. She was known as Hanafiyyah after her tribe Banu Hanifah. When
people of Yamamah were declared apostates for refusing to pay zakat
(religious tax) and were killed and their women-folk were brought to
Medina as slave girls, this lady also came to Medina with them. When her
tribesmen came to know it they approached Amir al-mu'minin and requested
him to save her from the blemish of slavery and protect her family
honour and prestige. Consequently, Amir al-mu'minin set her free after
purchasing and married here whereafter Muhammad was born. Most
historians have written his surname as Abu'l-Qasim. Thus, the author of
al-Isti\`ab (vol. 3, pp. 1366, 1367-1368, 1370, 1371-1372) has narrated
the opinion of Abu Rashid ibn Hafs az-Zuhri that from among the sons of
the companions (of the Prophet) he came across four individuals everyone
of whom was named Muhammad and surnamed Abu'l-Qasim, namely (1) Muhammad
ibn al-Hanafiyyah, (2) Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr (3) Muhammad ibn Talhah and
(4) Muhammad ibn Sa\`d. After this he writes that Muhammad ibn Talhah's
name and surname was given by the Prophet. al-Waqidi writes that the
name and surname of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was suggested by \`A'ishah.
Apparently the Holy Prophet's giving the name of Muhammad ibn Talhah
seems incorrect since from some traditions it appears that the Prophet
had reserved it for a son of Amir al-mu'minin and he was Muhammad ibn
al-Hanafiyyah. As regards his surname it is said that the Prophet had
particularised it and that he had told \`Ali that a son would be born to
you after me and I have given him my name and surname and after that it
is not permissible for anyone in my people to have this name and surname
together. With this opinion before us how can it be correct that the
Prophet had given this very name and surname to anyone else since
particularisation means that no one else would share it. Moreover, some
people have recorded the surname of Ibn Talhah as Abu Sulayman instead
of Abu'l-Qasim and this further confirms our view point. Similarly, if
the surname of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was on the ground that his son's
name was Qasim, who was among the theologians of Medina, then what is
the sense in \`A'ishah having suggested it. If she had suggested it
along with the name how could Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr tolerate it later on
since having been brought up under the care of Amir al-mu'minin the
Prophet's saying could not remain concealed from him. Moreover, most
people have recorded his surname as Abu \`Abd ar-Rahman, which weakens
the view of Abu Rashid. Let alone these people's surname being
Abu'l-Qasim, even for Ibn al-Hanafiyyah this surname is not proved.
Although Ibn Khallikan (in Wafayat al-a\`yan, vol. 4, p.170) has taken
that son of Amir al-mu'minin for whom the Prophet had particularised
this surname to be Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, yet al-\`Allamah
al-Mamaqani (in Tanqih al-maqal, vol. 3, Part 1, p. 112) writes: In
applying this tradition to Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, Ibn Khallikan has
got into confusion, because the son of Amir al- mu'minin whom the
Prophet's name and surname together have been gifted by the Prophet, and
which is not permissible to be given to any one else, is to the awaited
last Imam (may our lives be his ransom), and not to Muhammad ibn
al-Hanafiyyah, nor is the surname Abu'l- Qasim established for him,
rather some of the Sunnis being ignorant of the real intention of the
Prophet, have taken to mean Ibn al-Hanafiyyah. However, Muhammad ibn
al-Hanafiyyah was prominent in righteousness and piety, sublime in
renunciation and worship, lofty in knowledge and achievements and heir
of his father in bravery. His performance in the battles of Jamal and
Siffin had created such impression among the Arabs that even warriors of
consequence trembled at his name. Amir al-mu'minin too was proud of his
courage and valour, and always placed him forward in encounters.
ash-Shaykh al-Baha'i has written in al-Kashkul that \`Ali ibn Abi Talib
kept him abreast in the battles and did not allow Hasan and Husayn to go
ahead, and used to say, "He is my son while these two are sons of the
Prophet of Allah." When a Kharijite said to Ibn al-Hanafiyyah that \`Ali
thrust him into the flames of war but saved away Hasan and Husayn he
replied that he himself was like the right hand and Hasan and Husayn
like \`Ali's two eyes and that \`Ali protected his eyes with his right
hand. But al-\`Allamah al-Mamaqani has written in Tanqih al-Maqal that
this was not the reply of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah but of Amir al-mu'minin
himself. When during the battle of Siffin Muhammad mentioned this matter
to Amir al-mu'minin in a complaining tone he replied, "You are my right
hand whereas they are my eyes, and the hand should protect the eyes."
Apparently it seems that first Amir al-mu'minin must have given this
reply and thereafter someone might have mentioned it to Muhammad ibn
al-Hanafiyyah and he must have repeated the same reply as there could be
no more eloquent reply than this one and its eloquence confirms the view
that it was originally the outcome of the eloquent tongue of Amir
al-mu'minin and was later appropriated by Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah.
Consequently, both these views can be held to be correct and there is no
incongruity between them. However, he was born in the reign of the
second Caliph and died in the reign of \`Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan at the
age of sixty-five years. Some writers have recorded the year of his
death as 80 A.H. and others as 81 A.H. There is a difference about the
place of his death as well. Some have put it as Medina, some Aylah and
some Ta'if. ومن كلام له (عليه السلام) لابنه محمّد بن الحنفية لمّا أعطاه
الراية يوم الجمل Mountains When in the Battle of Jamal Amir al-mu'minin
sent Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah to the battle-field, he told him that he
should fix himself before the enemy like the mountain of determination
and resoluteness so that the onslaught of the army should not be able to
displace him, and should charge the enemy with closed teeth because by
pressing teeth over the teeth tension occurs in the nerves of the skull
as a result of which the stroke of the sword goes amiss, as he said at
another place also viz. "Press together the teeth. It sends amiss the
edge of the sword." Then he says, "My child, lend your head to Allah in
order that you may be able to achieve eternal life in place of this one,
because for a lent article there is the right to get it back. Therefore,
you should fight being heedless of your life, otherwise also if your
mind clings to life you will hesitate to advance towards deathly
encounters and that would tell upon your reputation of bravery. Look,
don't let your steps falter because the enemy is emboldened at the
faltering of steps, and faltering steps fastens the feet of the enemy.
Keep the last lines of the enemy as your aim so that the enemy may be
overawed with loftiness of your intentions and you may feel ease in
tearing through their lives, and their movement should also not remain
concealed from you. Look, do not pay heed to their superiority in
numbers, otherwise your valour and courage would suffer." This sentence
can also mean that one should not wide open the eyes to be dazzled by
the shining of weapons, and the enemy may make an attack by taking
advantage of the situation. Also, always bear it in mind that victory is
from Allah. "If Allah helps you no one can overpower you." Therefore,
instead of relying on material means seek His support and succour.
(Remember O' ye Believers!) If Allah helpeth you, none shall overcome
you...(Qur'an, 3:160)
