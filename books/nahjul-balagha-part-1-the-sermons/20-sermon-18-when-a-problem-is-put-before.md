Sermon 18: When a problem is put before ...
===========================================

*Amir al-mu’minin said in disparagement of the differences of view among
the theologians*

When[^1] a problem is put before anyone of them he passes judgement on
it from his imagination. When exactly the same problem is placed before
another of them he passes an opposite verdict. Then these judges go to
the chief who had appointed them and he confirms all the verdicts,
although their Allah is One (and the same), their Prophet is one (and
the same), their Book (the Qur’an) is one (and the same)!

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
تَرِدُ عَلَى أحَدِهِمُ القَضِيَّةُ في حُكْمٍ مِنَ الاْحْكَامِ
فَيَحْكُمُ فِيهَا بِرَأْيِهِ، ثُمَّ تَرِدُ تِلْكَ القَضِيَّةُ
بِعَيْنِهَا عَلَى غَيْرِهِ فَيَحْكُمُ فِيها بِخِلافِ قَوْلِهِ، ثُمَّ
يَجْتَمِعُ القُضَاةُ بِذلِكَ عِنْدَ إمامِهِم الَّذِي اسْتَقْضَاهُم
فَيُصَوِّبُ آرَاءَهُمْ جَمِيعاً، وَإِلهُهُمْ وَاحِدٌ! وَنَبِيُّهُمْ
وَاحِدٌ! وَكِتَابُهُمْ وَاحِدٌ!

Is it that Allah ordered them to differ and they obeyed Him? Or He
prohibited them from it but they disobeyed Him? Or (is it that) Allah
sent an incomplete Faith and sought their help to complete it? Or they
are His partners in the affairs, so that it is their share of duty to
pronounce and He has to agree? Or is it that Allah the Glorified sent a
perfect faith but the Prophet fell short of conveying it and handing it
over (to the people)? The fact is that Allah the Glorified says:

***We have not neglected anything in the Book (Qur’an) . . . (6:38),***

and in it is a ‘clarification of everything’[^2] And He says that one
part of the Qur’an verifies another part and that there is no divergence
in it as He says:

***.And if it had been from any other than Allah, they would surely have
found in it much discrepancy. (4:82)***

Certainly the outside of the Qur’an is wonderful and its inside is deep
(in meaning). Its wonders will never disappear, its amazements will
never pass away and its intricacies cannot be cleared except through
itself.

[^1]: It is a disputed problem that where there is no clear argument
about a matter in the religious law, whether there does in reality exist
an order about it or not. The view adopted by Abu'l-Hasan al-Ash\`ari
and his master Abu \`Ali al-Jubba'i is that in such a case Allah has not
ordained any particular course of action but He assigned the task of
finding it out and passing a verdict to the jurists so that whatever
they hold as prohibited would be deemed prohibited and whatever they
regard permissible would be deemed permissible. And if one has one view
and the other another then as many verdicts will exist as there are
views and each of them would represent the final order. For example, if
one scholar holds that barley malt is prohibited and another jurist's
view is that it is permissible then it would really be both prohibited
and permissible. That is, for one who holds it prohibited, its use would
be prohibited while for the other its use would be permissible. About
this (theory of) correctness Muhammad ibn Abdi'l-Karim ash-Shahrastani
writes: A group of theorists hold that in matters where ijtihad
(research) is applied there is no settled view about permissibility or
otherwise and lawfulness and prohibition thereof, but whatever the
mujtahid (the researcher scholar) holds is the order of Allah, because
the ascertainment of the view of Allah depends upon the verdict of the
mujtahid. If it is not so there will be no verdict at all. And according
to this view every mujtahid would be correct in his opinion. (al-Milal
wa'l-nihal, p.98) In this case, the mujtahid is taken to be above
mistake because a mistake can be deemed to occur where a step is taken
against reality, but where there is no reality of verdict, mistake has
no sense. Besides this, the mujtahid can be considered to be above
mistake if it is held that Allah, being aware of all the views that were
likely to be adopted has ordained as many final orders as a result of
which every view corresponds to some such order, or that Allah has
assured that the views adopted by the mujtahids should not go beyond
what He has ordained, or that by chance the view of every one of them
would, after all, correspond to some ordained order or other. The
Imamiyyah sect, however, has different theory, namely that Allah has
neither assigned to anyone the right to legislate nor subjected any
matter to the view of the mujtahid, nor in case of difference of views
has He ordained numerous real orders. Of course, if the mujtahid cannot
arrive at a real order then whatever view he takes after research and
probe, it is enough for him and his followers to act by it. Such an
order is the apparent order which is a substitute for the real order. In
this case, he is excused for missing the real order, because he did his
best for diving in the deep ocean and to explore its bottom, but it is a
pity that instead of pearls he got only the sea-shell. He does not say
that observers should except it as a pearl or it should sell as such. It
is a different matter that Allah who watches the endeavours may price it
at half so that the endeavour does not go waste, nor his passion
discouraged. If the theory of correctness is adopted then every verdict
on law and every opinion shall have to be accepted as correct as
Maybudhi has written in Fawatih: In this matter the view adopted by
al-Ash\`ari is right. It follows that differing opinions should all be
right. Beware, do not bear a bad idea about jurists and do not open your
tongue to abuse them. When contrary theories and divergent views are
accepted as correct it is strange why the action of some conspicuous
individuals are explained as mistakes of decision, since mistake of
decision by the mujtahid cannot be imagined at all. If the theory of
correctness is right the action of Mu\`awiyah and \`A'ishah should be
deemed right; but if their actions can be deemed to be wrong then we
should agree that ijtihad can also go wrong, and that the theory of
correctness is wrong. It will then remain to be decided in its own
context whether feminism did not impede the decision of \`A'ishah or
whether it was a (wrong) finding of Mu\`awiyah or something else.
However, this theory of correctness was propounded in order to cover
mistakes and to give them the garb of Allah's orders so that there
should be no impediment in achieving objectives nor should anyone be
able to speak against any misdeeds. In this sermon Amir al-mu'minin has
referred to those people who deviate from the path of Allah and, closing
their eyes to light, grope in the darkness of imagination, make Faith
the victim of their views and opinions, pronounce new findings, pass
orders by their own imagination and produce divergent results. Then on
the basis of the theory of correctness they regard all these divergent
and contrary orders as from Allah, as though each of their order
represents divine Revelation so that no order of theirs can be wrong nor
can they stumble on any occasion. Thus, Amir al-mu'minin says in
disproving this view that: 1) When Allah is One, Book (Qur'an) is one,
and Prophet is one then the religion (that is followed) should also be
one. And when the religion is one how can there be divergent orders
about any matter, because there can be divergence in an order only in
case he who passed the order has forgotten it, or is oblivious, or
senselessness overtakes him, or he wilfully desires entanglement in
these labyrinths, while Allah and the Prophet are above these things.
These divergences cannot therefore be attributed to them. These
divergences are rather the outcome of the thinkings and opinions of
people who are bent on twisting the delineations of religion by their
own imaginative performances. 2) Allah must have either forbidden these
divergences or ordered creating them. If He has ordered in their favour,
where is that order and at what place? As for forbidding, the Qur'an
says: . . .Say thou! 'Hath Allah permitted you or ye forge a lie against
Allah ?' (10:59) That is, everything that is not in accordance with the
Divine orders is a concoction, and concoction is forbidden and
prohibited. For concocters, in the next world, there is neither success
or achievement nor prosperity and good. Thus, Allah says: And utter ye
not whatever lie describe your tongues (saying): This is lawful and this
is forbidden, to forge a lie against Allah; verily, those who forge a
lie against Allah succeed not. (Qur'an, 16:116) 3) If Allah has left
religion incomplete and the reason for leaving it halfway was that He
desired that the people should assist Him in completing the religious
code and share with Him in the task of legislating, then this belief is
obviously polytheism. If He sent down the religion in complete form the
Prophet must have failed in conveying it so that room was left for
others to apply imagination and opinion. This, Allah forbid, would mean
a weakness of the Prophet and a bad slur on the selection of Allah. 4)
Allah has said in the Qur'an that He has not left out anything in the
Book and has clarified each and every matter. Now, if an order is carved
out in conflict with the Qur'an it would be outside the religious code
and its basis would not be on knowledge and perception, or Qur'an and
sunnah, but it would be personal opinion and one's personal judgement
which cannot be deemed to have accord with religion and faith. 5) Qur'an
is the basis and source of religion and the fountain head of the laws of
shari\`ah. If the laws of shari\`ah were divergent there should have
been divergence in it also, and if there were divergences in it, it
could not be regarded as Divine word. When it is Divine word the laws of
shari\`ah cannot be divergent, so as to accept all divergent and
contrary views as correct and imaginative verdicts taken as Qur'anic
dictates.
