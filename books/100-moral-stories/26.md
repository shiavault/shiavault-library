BUTTERFLYAND COCOON
A man found a cocoon of a butterfly. One day a small opening appeared;
he sat and watched the

butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through
that little hole. Then it seemed

to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as
it could and it could go no

farther.

Then the man decided to help the butterfly, so he took a pair of
scissors

and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then

emerged easily. But it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.

The man continued to watch the butterfly because he expected that, at
any

moment, the wings would enlarge and expand to be able to support the

body, which would contract in time.

Neither happened! In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life
crawling

around with a swollen body and shriveled wings. It never was able to
fly.

What this man in his kindness and haste did not understand was that the

restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the butterfly to get

through the tiny opening were nature's way of forcing fluid from the
body

of the butterfly into its wings so that it would be ready for flight
once it

achieved its freedom from the cocoon.

Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If nature
allowed us to go

through our life without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would
not be as strong

as what we could have been. And we could never fly...
