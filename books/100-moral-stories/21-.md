TRUE WEALTH
One day a father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the
country with the purpose of

showing his son how the poor people live so he could be thankful for his
wealth.

They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be
considered a very poor family.

On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, “How was the
trip?” “It was great, Dad.”

“Did you see how poor people can be?” the father asked. “Oh yeah” said
the son. “So what did you

learn from the trip?” asked the father.

The son answered, “I saw that we have one dog and they had four.

We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they

have a creek that has no end.” “We have imported lanterns in our

garden and they have the stars at night.” “Our patio reaches to the

front yard and they have the whole horizon.” “We have a small

piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our

sight.” “We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.”

“We buy our food, but they grow theirs.” “We have walls around

our property to protect us; they have friends to protect them.”

With this the boy’s father was speechless. Then his son added, “Thanks
dad for showing me how

poor we are.”
