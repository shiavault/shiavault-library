THE ONE-EYED DOE
A Doe had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes, and could not see any
one

approaching her on that side. So to avoid any danger she always used to
feed on

a high cliff near the sea, with her sound eye looking towards the land.
By this

means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land, and
often

escaped by this means. But the hunters found out that she was blind of
one eye,

and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot
her from

the sea. “Ah,” cried she with her dying voice. “You cannot escape your
fate.”
