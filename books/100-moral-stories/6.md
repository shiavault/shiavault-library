THE ANT AND THE DOVE
One hot day, an ant was searching for some water.

After walking around for some time, she came to a spring.

To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass.

While making her way up, she slipped and fell into the water.

She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not

seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly

plucked off a leaf and dropped it into the water near the

struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and

climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground.

Just at that time, a hunter nearby was throwing out his net

towards the dove, hoping to trap it.

Guessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly bit him on

the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net. The

dove was quick to fly away to safety.

One good turn deserves another.
