THE FOX AND THE STORK
A selfish fox once invited a stork to dinner at his home in a hollow
tree. That evening, the stork flew

to the fox’s home and knocked on the door with her long beak. The fox
opened the door and said,

“Please come in and share my food.”

The stork was invited to sit down at the table. She was very hungry and
the food smelled delicious!

The fox served soup in shallow bowls and he licked up all his soup very
quickly. However, the stork

could not have any of it as the bowl was too shallow for her long beak.
The poor stork just smiled

politely and stayed hungry.

The selfish fox asked, “Stork, why haven’t you taken your soup? Don’t
you like it?”

The stork replied, “It was very kind of you to invite me for dinner.

Tomorrow evening, please join me for dinner at my home.”

The next day, when the fox arrived at the stork’s home, he

saw that they were also having soup for dinner. This time

the soup was served in tall jugs. The stork drank the soup

easily but the fox could not reach inside the tall jug. This

time it was his turn to go hungry.

A selfish act can backfire on you.
