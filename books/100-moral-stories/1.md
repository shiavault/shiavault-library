DON'T CHANGE THE WORLD
Once upon a time, there was a king who ruled a prosperous country. One
day, he went for a trip to

some distant areas of his country. When he was back to his palace, he
complained that his feet were

very painful, because it was the first time that he went for such a long
trip, and the road that he

went through was very rough and stony. He then ordered his people to
cover every road of the

entire country with leather.

Definitely, this would need thousands of cows’ skin, and would cost a

huge amount of money.

Then one of his wise servants dared himself to tell the king, “Why do

you have to spend that unnecessary amount of money? Why don’t you

just cut a little piece of leather to cover your feet?”

The king was surprised, but he later agreed to his suggestion, to make

a “shoe” for himself.

There is actually a valuable lesson of life in this story: to make this
world a happy

place to live, you better change yourself - your heart; and not the
world.
