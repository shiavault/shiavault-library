THE OBSTACLE IN OUR PATH
In ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid
himself and watched to

see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king’s wealthiest
merchants and courtiers

came by and simply walked around it.

Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none
did anything about getting

the big stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load
of vegetables. On

approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to
move the stone to the side

of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. As
the peasant picked up his

load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the
boulder had been.

The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the

king indicating that the gold was for the person who

removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant

learned what many others never understand.

Every obstacle presents an opportunity to

improve one’s condition.
