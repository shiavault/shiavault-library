THE WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING
A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the
vigilance of the

shepherd and his dogs. But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had
been

flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled
down

among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the
Wolf

was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep’s clothing; so,
leading the

Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he

succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.

Appearances are deceptive.
