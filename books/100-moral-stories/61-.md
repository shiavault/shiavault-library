ABOX FULLOF KISSES
The story goes back some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old
daughter for

wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became
infuriated

when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
Nevertheless,

the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and
said, “This is for

you, Daddy.”

The man was embarrassed by his earlier over reaction, but his anger
flared again when he found

out the box was empty. He yelled at her, stating, “Don’t you know, when
you give someone a

present, there is supposed to be something inside?” The little girl
looked up at him with tears in

her eyes and cried, “Oh, Daddy, it’s not empty at all. I blew kisses
into the box. They’re all for you,

Daddy.” The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl,
and he begged for her

forgiveness.

Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. It is
also told that her father kept that

gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he
would take out an

imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.

In a very real sense, each one of us, as humans beings, have been given
a gold container filled with

unconditional love and kisses... from our children, family members,
friends, and God. There is

simply no other possession, anyone could hold, more precious than this.
