THE THIRSTYCROW
One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for

water. For a long time, she could not find any. She felt very weak,

almost giving up hope.

Suddenly, she saw a water jug below her. She flew straight down

to see if there was any water inside. Yes, she could see some water

inside the jug!

The crow tried to push her head into the jug. Sadly, she found

that the neck of the jug was too narrow. Then she tried to push

the jug down for the water to flow out. She found that the jug

was too heavy.

The crow thought hard for a while. Then looking around her, she

saw some pebbles. She suddenly had a good idea. She started

picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug.

As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept

rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. Her plan had

worked!

If you try hard enough, you may soon find an answer to your problem.
