MENTALLYRETARDED!
A few years ago, at the Seattle Special Olympics, nine contestants, all
physically or

mentally disabled, assembled at the starting line for the 100-yard dash.

At the gun, they all started out, not exactly in a dash, but with a
relish to run the

race to the finish and win. All, that is, except one little boy who
stumbled on the

asphalt, tumbled over a couple of times, and began to cry. The other
eight heard the boy cry. They

slowed down and looked back. Then they all turned around and went
back.....every one of them.

One girl with Down’s syndrome bent down and kissed him and said, “This
will make it better.”

Then all nine linked arms and walked together to the finish line.
Everyone in the stadium stood,

and the cheering went on for several minutes. People who were there are
still telling the story.

Why? Because deep down we know this one thing: What matters in this life
is more

than winning for ourselves. What matters in this life is helping others
win, even if it

means slowing down and changing our course.
