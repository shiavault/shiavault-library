Tract on The Beliefs of The Shi'a Imamiya
=========================================

**In the name of Allah, The Merciful, The Compassionate.**

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, Single is He and
without associate; and may the blessings of Allah and His greetings be
upon Muhammad and his excellent and pure progeny. Sufficient for us is
Allah, and He is the best of Agents and the best of those on whom we
rely.
