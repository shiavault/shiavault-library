Editorial Note
==============

The object of the Editors of this series is a very definite one. They
desire above all things that, in their humble way, these books shall be
the ambassadors of good-will and understanding between East and
West--the old world of Thought and the new of Action. In this endeavour,
and in their own sphere, they are but followers of the highest example
in the land.

They are confident that a deeper knowledge of the great ideals and
lofty philosophy of Oriental thought may help to a revival of that true
spirit of Charity which neither despises nor fears the nations of
another creed and colour. Finally, in thanking press and public for the
very cordial reception given to the "Wisdom of the East" Series, they
wish to, state that no pains have been spared to secure the best
specialists for the treatment of the various subjects at hand.

**Preface**

RENAN, whose easy-going mind was the exact antithesis to the intense
earnestness of Ghazzali, calls him "the most original mind among Arabian
philosophers." Notwithstanding this, his fame as a philosopher has been
greatly overshadowed by Avicenna, his predecessor, and Averroes, his
successor and opponent. It is a significant fact that the Encyclop?dia
Britannica devotes five columns to each of the others and only a column
and a half to Ghazzali.

Yet it is doubtful whether it is as a philosopher that be would have
wished to be chiefly remembered. Several of his works, it is true, are
polemics against the philosophers, especially his Tehafot-al-falasifa,
or "Destruction of the philosophers," and, as Solomon Munk says in his
Melanges de philosophie Juive et Arabe, Ghazzali dealt "a fatal blow" to
Arabian philosophy in the East, from which it never recovered, though it
revived for a while in Spain .

and culminated in Averroes. Philosopher and sceptic as he was by
nature, Ghazzali's chief work was that of a theologian, moralist, and
mystic, though his mysticism was strongly balanced by common sense. He
had, as he tells. us in his Confessions, experienced "conversion"; God
had arrested him "on the edge of the fire," and thenceforth what
Browning says of the French poet, Rene Gentilhomme, was true of him:

**Human praises scare**

Rather than soothe ears all a-tingle yet With tones few hear and live,
and none forget.

In the same work he tells us that one of his besetting weaknesses had
been the craving for applause, and in his Ihya-ul-ulum ("Revival of the
Religious Sciences") he devotes a long chapter to the dangers involved
in a love of notoriety and the cure for it.

After his conversion he retired into religious. seclusion for eleven
years at Damascus (a corner of the mosque there still bears his
name--"The Ghazzali Corner") and Jerusalem, where he gave himself up to
intense and prolonged meditation. But he was too noble a character to
concentrate himself entirely on his own soul and its eternal
prospects.

The requests of his children--and other family affairs of which we have
no exact information--caused him to return home. Besides this, the
continued progress of the Ismailians (connected with the famous
Assassins), the spread of irreligious doctrines and the increasing.
religious indifference of the masses not only filled Ghazzali and his
Sufi friends with profound grief, but determined them to stem the, evil
with the whole force of their philosophy, the ardour of vital
conviction, and the authority of noble example.

In his autobiography referred to above Ghazzali tells us that, after
emerging from a state of Pyrrhonic scepticism, he had finally arrived at
the conclusion that the mystics were on the right path and true
"Arifin," or Knowers of God. 1 But in saying this he meant those Sufis
whose mysticism did not carry them into, extravagant utterances like
that of Mansur Hallaj, who was crucified at Bagdad (A.D. 922) for
exclaiming "I am the Truth, or God." In his Ihya-ul-ulum Ghazzali says:
"The matter went so far that certain persons boasted of a union with the
Deity, and chat in His unveiled presence they beheld Him, and enjoyed
familiar converse with Him, saying, "Thus it was spoken unto us and thus
we speak.

" Bayazid Bistami (ob. A. D. 875) is reported to have exclaimed, "Glory
be to me!" This style of discourse exerts a very pernicious influence on
the common people. Some husbandmen indeed, letting their farms run to
waste, set up similar pretensions for themselves; for human nature is
pleased with maxims like these, which permit one to neglect useful
labour with the idea of acquiring .spiritual purity through the
attainment of certain mysterious degrees and qualities.

This notion is productive of great injury, so that the death of one of
these foolish babblers would be a, greater benefit to the cause of true
religion than the saving alive of ten of them."

For himself Ghazzali was a practical mystic. His aim was to make men
better by leading them from a merely notional acquiescence in the
stereotyped creed of Islam to a real knowledge of God. The first four
chapters of The Alchemy of Happiness are a commentary on the famous
verse in the Hadis (traditional sayings of, Muhammad), "He who knows
himself knows God.

" He is especially scornful of the parrotlike repetition of orthodox
phrases. Thus alluding to the almost hourly use by Muhammadans of the
phrase, "I take refuge in God" (Naudhibillah!), Ghazzali says, in the
Ihya-ul-ulum: "Satan laughs at such pious ejaculations. Those who utter
them are like a man who .should meet a lion in a desert, while there is
a fort at no great distance, and, when he sees the evil beast, should
stand exclaiming, 'I take refuge in that fortress,' without moving a
step towards it.

What will such an ejaculation profit him? In the same way the mere
exclamation, 'I take refuge in God,' will not protect thee from the
terrors of His judgment unless thou really take refuge in Him." It is
related of some unknown Sufi that when, asked for a definition of
religious sincerity he drew a red-hot piece of iron out of a
blacksmith's forge, and said, "Behold it!" This "red-hot" sincerity is
certainly characteristic of Ghazzali, and there is no wonder that he did
not admire his contemporary, Omar Khayyam.

The little picture of the lion and the fort in the above passage is a
small instance of another conspicuous trait in Ghazzali's mind--his turn
for allegory. Emerson says, "Whoever thinks, intently will find an image
more or less luminous rise in his mind." In Ghazzali's writings many
such images arise, some grotesque and some beautiful.

His allegory of the soul as a fortress beleaguered by the "armies of
Satan" is a striking anticipation of the Holy War of Bunyan. The
greatest of all the Sufi poets, Jalaluddin Rumi, born a century after
Ghazzali's death (A.D. 1207), has paid him the compliment of
incorporating several of these allegories which occur in the Ihya into
his own Masnavi. Such is the famous one of the Chinese and Greek
artists, which runs as follows:

"Once upon a time the Chinese having challenged the Greeks to a trial
of skill in painting, the Sultan summoned them both into edifices built
for the purpose directly facing each other, and commanded them to show
proof of their art. The painters of the two nations immediately applied
themselves with diligence to their work. The Chinese sought and obtained
of the king every day a great quantity of colours, but the Greeks not
the least particle. Both worked in profound silence, until the with a
clangor of cymbals and of trumpets, announced the end of their
labours.

Immediately the king, with his courtiers, hastened to their temple, and
there stood amazed at the wonderful splendour of the Chinese painting
and the exquisite beauty of the colours. But meanwhile the Greeks, who
had not sought to adorn the walls with paints, but laboured rather to
erase every colour, drew aside the veil which concealed their work.
Then, wonderful to tell, the manifold variety of the Chinese colours was
seen still more delicately and beautifully reflected from the walls of
the Grecian temple, as it stood illuminated by the rays of the midday
sun."

This parable, of course, illustrates the favourite Sufi tenet that the
heart must he kept pure and calm as an unspotted mirror. Similarly, the
epologue of the elephant in the dark (vide chap. II.) has been borrowed
by Jalaluddin Rumi from Ghazzali.

Another characteristic of Ghazzali which appeals to the, modern mind is
the way in which he expounds the religious argument from probability
much as Bishop Butler and Browning do (vide the end of Chapter IV. in
the present book). Ghazzali might have said, with Blougram:

With me faith means perpetual unbelief

Kept quiet like the snake 'neath Michael's foot, Who stands calm just
because he feels it writhe.

This combination of ecstatic assurance and scepticism is one of those
antinomies of the human mind which annoy the rationalist and rejoice the
mystic. Those in whom they coexist, like Ghazzali in the eleventh
century and Cardinal Newman in the nineteenth, are a perpetual problem
to understand and therefore perennially interesting:

He may believe, and yet, and yet,

**How can he?**

Another point in which Ghazzali anticipates Bishop Butler is his
representation of punishment as the natural working out of consequences,
and not an arbitrary infliction imposed ab extra. He tries to
rationalise the lurid threatenings of the Koran.

In his own day Ghazzali was accused of having one doctrine for the
multitude and one for himself and his intimate friends. Professor D. B.
Macdonald, of Hartford, after going thoroughly into the matter, says,
"If the charge of a secret doctrine is to be proved against Ghazzali it
must be on other and better evidence than that which is now before
us."

At any rate, Ghazzali has been accepted as an orthodox authority by the
Muhammadans, among whom his title is Hujjat-el-Islam "The Proof of
Islam," and it has been said, "If all the books of Islam were destroyed
it would be, but a slight loss if only the Ihya of Ghazzali were
preserved." The great modern reformer of Islam in India, the late Sir
Syud Ahmed, has had some portions of this enormous work printed
separately for the purpose of familiarising the young Moslems at Aligarh
with Ghazzali.

The Ihya was written in Arabic, and Ghazzali himself wrote an
abridgment of it in Persian for popular use which he entitled Kimiya'e
Saadat ("The Alchemy of Happiness"). This little book contains eight
sections of that abridgment. Theologians are the best judges of
theologians, and in conclusion we may quote Dr. August Tholuck's opinion
of Ghazzali: "This man, if ever any have deserved the name, was truly a
'divine,' and he may be justly placed on a level with Origen, so
remarkable was he for learning and ingenuity, and gifted with such a
rare faculty for the skilful and worthy exposition of doctrine.

All that is good, noble, and sublime that his great soul had compassed
he bestowed upon Muhammadanism, and he adorned the doctrines of the
Koran with so much piety and learning that, in the form given them by
him, they seem, in my opinion, worthy the assent of Christians.
Whatsoever was most excellent in the philosophy of Aristotle or in the
Sufi mysticism he discreetly adapted to the Muhammadan theology; from
every school he sought the means of shedding light and honour upon
religion; while his sincere piety and lofty conscientiousness imparted
to all his writings a sacred majesty. He was the first of Muhammadan
divines."

**Introduction**

KNOW, O beloved, that man was not created in jest or at random, but
marvellously made and for some great end. Although he is not from
everlasting, yet he lives for ever; and though his body is mean and
earthly, yet his spirit is lofty and divine. When in the crucible of
abstinence he is purged from carnal passions he attains to the highest,
and in place of being a slave to lust and anger becomes endued with
angelic qualities.

Attaining that state, he finds his heaven in the contemplation of
Eternal Beauty, and no longer in fleshly delights. The spiritual alchemy
which operates this change in him, like that which transmutes base
metals into gold, is not easily discovered, nor to be found in the house
of every old woman.

It is to explain that alchemy and its methods of operation that the
author has undertaken this work, which he has entitled, The Alchemy of
Happiness. Now the treasuries of God, in which this alchemy is to be
sought, are the hearts of the prophets, and he, who seeks it elsewhere
will be disappointed and bankrupt on the day of judgment, when he hears
the words, "We have lifted the veil from off thee, and thy sight to-day
is keen."

God has sent on earth a hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets 2 to
teach men the prescription of this alchemy, and how to purify their
hearts from baser qualities in the crucible of abstinence. This alchemy
may be briefly described as turning away from the world to God, and its
constituents are four:

1. The knowledge of self.
2. The knowledge of God.
3. The knowledge of this world as it really is.
4. The knowledge of the next world as it really is.
We shall now proceed to expound these four constituents in order.

1. It may be noted that there was a contemporary sect called
"La-adria"--agnostics.
2. This is the fixed number of the prophets according to Muhammadan
tradition.
