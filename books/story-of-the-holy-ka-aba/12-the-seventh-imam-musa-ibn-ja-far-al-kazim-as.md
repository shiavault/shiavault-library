The Seventh Imam Musa Ibn Ja’far Al-Kazim (as)
==============================================

Born in Madina on 7th Safar 128 Hijri (10.11.745AD). Died in Baghdad
Iraq 25th Rajab 183 Hijri (4.9.799 AD) Period of Imamate was 35 years.

Imam Musa Ibn Ja’far was born during the struggle between the Ummayads
and the Abbasids. He was only four years old when Abul Abbas “Saffah”,
“The Shedder of Blood”, came to the throne as the first Abbasid caliph.
For twenty years he was under the authority of his father, who died ten
years before the end of the long reign of Mansur.

The Imamate of the 7th Imam extended through the ten remaining years of
the caliphate of Mansur, and included the ten years of the rule of
Mahdi, one year and some months of Hadi and about twelve years of the
reign of Harun al- Rashid. Thus for thirty five years he was the Imam.
He held this coveted distinction as the longest period of Imamate of the
Eleven Imams.

With six brothers and nine sisters Imam Musa (as) grew up in a large
family. Ismail the oldest brother died at a young age and Musa was
chosen by Divine providence to succeed his father as the Imam. There
were those among the followers of the 6th Imam who thought that Imamate
should be hereditary and therefore the eldest son of the 6th Imam should
succeed.

They misunderstood the whole concept of Imamate which was neither
hereditary nor mandatory for any one person. It was divinely selected
and the Imam at his death bed reveals the name of the next Imam.

The Abbasid caliphs were always on the alert with this distinctive
source of Imamate and our 7th Imam was fully aware of this danger. The
Caliphs were on the alert to discover any real or imaginary disloyalty
with the Imam or his followers and they would immediately put them under
arrest.

This natural anxiety, however, does not appear to have seriously
interrupted his life as an Imam. He continued to disseminate Qura’nic
teachings as his father Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (as) used to do through the
Islamic schools opened in Madina during the life of the 5th Imam.

Ibn Khalikan related that caliph Mansur saw in his dream Imam ‘Ali (as)
who was reciting the verse from the Qur’an, “O’Muhammad, were you ready
therefore, if you had been put in authority, to commit evil on the earth
and to violate the ties of blood.” Mansur sent for his favorite
companion Ibn Younus at night and told him of his dream.

He then said,” bring me Musa Ibn Ja’far.” The Imam Musa ibn Ja’far was
brought in all the way from Madina to Baghdad. When he arrived Mansur
embraced him and said to him, “Abul Hasan, I have just seen in a dream
‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib (as) who was reciting this verse.

Give me your assurance that you will not revolt against me or against
any of my children. Imam replied, By Allah I have no such intentions.
The caliph then gave him a thousand dinars and restored him to his
family in Madina.

This story give us some idea how these Abbasid caliphs were so afraid of
the Imams of Ahlul Bayt that in spite of their total lack of evidence
for any kind of revolt against their earthly power, they would not leave
them alone.

From time to time the Imams were brought in from Madina, kept in Baghdad
either on house arrest or inside prisons under the most difficult of
conditions. But it was the Imams great Divine Characters that managed to
keep them going in the most severe of conditions. It is because of these
uncertain times that the Imam said,

“How base is the world for a people, unless God give them joy; and how
great is this life , if God is not angry with them.” Total submission to
the Will of God in all circumstances.

It was widely known that Imam Musa Ibn Ja’far had been given powers of
healing. Once he was passing by a house and heard little children
weeping. He enquired as to why they were crying. He was told that they
were orphans and their mother had just died and now they had no one to
look after them.

He went inside the house, made two prostrations and prayed to God for
her life. Moments later the woman stood up well and in good health.
People who saw this and cried out, “Behold it is Jesus son of Mary.”

Once Harun al Rashid was visiting Madina. He went to the mosque of the
Prophet near his grave and said, My Salaams to you O’cousin of our
fathers. Imam Musa was there who saluted the grave of the Prophet with
the words, My Salams to you O’our grandfather. At this Al-Rashid was
disconcerted and went away angry.

This occurrence was sufficient to explain his first summons from Al
Rashid to come to Baghdad. There he was kept in prison. But after nearly
a year in prison Harun saw in a dream that an Abyssinian slave was
rushing towards him with a javelin and telling him to release Musa Ibn
Ja’far or he will slay him.

Harun immediately called the head of the prison and told him to release
the Imam and give him thirty thousand Dirhams. When this man reached the
door of the prison he found Imam was waiting for him and welcomed him,
saying how quickly he had come to release him. The man said how did he
know.

Imam replied “I saw the Holy Prophet in my dream who told me to recite
these words and then I will be released from prison for I had been put
here unjustly." The man asked what were those words, Imam replied,

“O thou who hearest every voice,

O thou who lets no opportunity escape;

O thou who clothes the bones with flesh

and who wilt raise them up after death;

I invoke thee by thy Holy name, and by that great and splendid name
which is treasured up and closely hidden, by that name which no created
thing shall ever know;

O thou who art so mild and whose patience is never equaled;

O thou whose favors never cease and cannot be numbered, set me free.
(Masudi, Muruj el Dhahab)

So you see what happened. The superintendent of prisons was
flabbergasted and released the Imam immediately, organized an escort for
him to take him to Madinah.

Character and Virtues
---------------------

Imam Musa Ibn Ja’far (as) was one of the illustrious Imams who God had
set a paragon of moral excellence. Each member of this noble family
possessed cardinal virtues. Naturally in some individuals a particular
virtue is dominant and more conspicuous. The seventh Imam excelled in
tolerance and forgiveness, so much so that he was entitled al-Kazim, the
suppressor of anger.

Never was he heard speaking roughly or harshly to anyone. Even in the
most unpleasant situations, he was seen smiling bearing the pain
gracefully. This was in accordance with the saying of his ancestor Imam
‘Ali (as) that the faithful keeps his grief confined in his heart with a
smile on his face.

One State official of Madina was a persistent source of harassment to
the Imam. He even used abusive language regarding Imam ‘Ali. (as) But
our 7th Imam always directed his followers not to retaliate in the same
abusive manner.

When his manner became too rude to be tolerated, Imam’s followers sought
permission from the Imam to retaliate against him. The Imam appeased
them, promising to decide the matter in his own way.

Pacifying his followers, the Imam went to that man on his Farm and
treated him with such noble benevolence that the man felt ashamed of his
conduct and subsequently changed his attitude and altered his conduct.
Explaining his policy to his followers, the Imam asked,“ Was my behavior
better than the methods you suggested?”

They admitted that it certainly was. He thus carried out the
instructions of his great ancestor Imam ‘Ali (as) which is recorded in
Nahjul Balagha to subdue the enemy with benevolence since it is more
effective than trying to defeat them with the same methods. No doubt
this requires a correct judgement of your adversary’s nature. Imam ‘Ali
(as) has therefore warned not to use this policy with the vile and mean,
or they will be encouraged to do more mischief.

To vanquish the enemy with goodness certainly requires the foresight the
Imam possessed. Strictness is permissible only when the enemy’s
continuous vile conduct justifies retaliation or the use of force. If
not, these dignified Nufus preferred to deal with that kind of person
gently so as to have a valid pretext against the opponent and leave no
ground for him to justify his aggression.

This was the noble method usually adopted by all members of Ahlul Bayt.
Imam ‘Ali (as) even on his death bed behaved liberally with Ibn Muljim
who had dealt him a mortal blow only the day before. Imam Musa Ibn
Ja’far (as) showered his generosity on many of his relatives even when
he knew that some of them were envious of him and conspired with the
ruler of the time Harun al-Rashid.

As to what may have led to his final imprisonment, we find that it is
stated by Al-Fakhri that there were some of the relatives of Musa Ibn
a’afar who were envious of him and carried false reports about him to
Al-Rashid, saying, “The people paying him the Khums, or one fifth of the
property, are accepting the Imamate and he is about to revolt against
you”.

They brought this report to Al-Rashid so frequently that it made him
anxious and agitated. He gave the accuser some money to keep bringing
him more information. But it is related through authentic sources that
this relative of the Imam did not have the chance of enjoying that
reward for espionage, for as soon as he reached Madinah, he suffered a
serious illness and died from it.

It was in that year that Al-Rashid went on the pilgrimage, and when he
arrived in Madina, he arrested the Imam Musa Ibn Ja’far, brought him to
Baghdad and imprisoned him under the care of al-Sindi ibn Shahik.
(Al-Fakhri-Ibnul Tiktika)

This agrees with Majlisi’s comment in Bihar al Anwar that “Harun took
him from Madina ten days from the end of the month of Shawwal 177
Hijiri. Then Harun set out for Makka and took the Imam with him when he
returned to Basra and had him imprisoned with Issa. About one year later
he was taken out of the Basran prison and taken to Baghdad.

He was put in prison there under the watchful eye of the cruelest person
named al-Sindi. Majlisi goes on to say that the Imam died in his prison
and was buried in the cemetery of Quraish on the south side of Baghdad.

Al-Fakhri adds,” Al-Rashid was at Rakka and sent orders that he should
be put to death. They then brought a number of so called reputable men
to Karkh to act as coroners and to testify publicly that the Imam died a
natural death.

The place he was buried was a cemetery of the Quraish. But soon this
place became the focus of pilgrimage on the grave of the Imam. A town
grew around the grave yard. The name of the town became Kazimiya, the
town of the Imam Kazim (as) A reputed school of theology was founded in
this town which is still a source of learning for many students from all
over the world.
