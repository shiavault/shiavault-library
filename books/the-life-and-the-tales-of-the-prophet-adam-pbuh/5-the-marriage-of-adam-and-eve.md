The Marriage of Adam and Eve
============================

What was mentioned about the marriage of Adam and Eve from the
Household members (PUT) is that when God created Adam (PUH) from sand
and breathed in him from His Spirit and Made the Angels prostrate before
him, he got asleep, and while he was sleeping God created Eve as He did
create Adam (PUH) from a mud of the same type of the mud of Adam or from
the remains of his mud, and Made her stuck to his side in a position
between his hips, and that to make woman belonging to man.

When God founded the soul into her she moved and Adam got awake for her
movement, and she was called to move away from him, and when Adam looked
at her he saw a pretty creation that looks like him but she was a
female, and talked to her and she spoke with his language, then he said
to her: who are you? So she said: a creation made by God as you can see.
Then Adam talked to his Lord and said: O Lord,

who is this creation who I got amused for being with and looking at?
Then said God, the Exalted: this is My slave, Eve, would you like her to
be with you for your amusement and talk with you and be under your
command? So Adam said: Yes O Lord, and thanks and praise be to You as
long as I live.

Then God did say: ask for her engagement from Me, for she is My slave
and she is the one for lust too. And God dropped the lust over
him(Adam), and he did say: O Lord, I ask for her engagement for myself,
what would make You satisfy? Then God did say: My satisfaction would be
to teach her My faith.

Then Adam (PUH) did say: that would be for You O Lord, as long as You
want it. Then God did say: I wanted so, and she is your wife for what I
have asked you to do, so take her to your side. So then Adam (PUH)
accepted that and been satisfied, then Adam did say: come to me, then
she said: but you have to come to me, then God ordered Adam to go to her
and so he did, and if it wasn't that women would go by themselves to men
to make engagements, and this is the story of the marriage of Adam and
Eve.

It is famous in the public that Eve was created from the left rib of
Adam, and this was denied by members of the Household (PUT), it was been
told that when Al-Imam Al-Sadiq (PUH) was asked about this matter and
the questioner showed that is it famous in the public that Eve was
created from the left rib of Adam,

so then Al-Sadiq (PUH) did say: praise be to God and Exalted He shall
be above all what they say, who says that God did not have the ability
to create a wife for Adam but from his rib and make a way for who talks
in ill manner to say that Adam got married to himself as long she is
made from his rib, not for these people did God judge between them and
us.

From Al-Imam Al-Razi [famous medicine and science man and some say he
was a Shiite and got his teachings and wisdom from the Imams of the
Household PUT, and God only Knows] in his interpretation for God's
saying "O mankind! Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created you
from a single soul and from it created its mate"(Al-Nesa': 1) : what is
meant by this mate is Eve, and about the creation of Eve from Adam there
are two sayings, the first: and it is the most common, that when God
created Adam, made him sleep then Created Eve from one of his left
ribs,

so when he got awake and saw her, he got inclined to her because she
was made from one of his parts. This saying was supported by the saying
of the prophet (PUH): the woman is made of a rib, so whenever you want
to make it straight it would be broken and if you left it bent, you
would enjoy it. This is what they said and God only knows, for
supporting their believe and claims.

The second saying: and it is the choice of Abi Muslim Al-Asfahani: what
is meant by God's saying "and from it created its mate" meaning from its
type and it is like God's saying "He created for you helpmeets from
yourselves"(Al-Rum: 21) and like His saying "by sending unto them a
messenger of their own"(Al-Imran: 164)

And there are explanations and opinions and discoveries made and born
by the ideas of philosophists and it was not the first flask to be
broken in Islam, for there are so many inventors and makers, and God did
say "follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge" (Al-Esra',Bani
Isra'il: 36) and "Assuredly conjecture can by no means take the place of
truth"(Yunus: 36) and "Hath Allah permitted you, or do ye invent a lie
concerning Allah?"(Yunus: 59) and "Ask the followers of the Remembrance
if ye know not!"(Al-Nahl: 43)

The truth is what was said by the members of the Household (PUT), and
they know better. And it is necessary to remember that what is agreed on
by logic and as transfered by speech that God, the Exalted, Is able to
Create anything anyhow He likes, and when He created Adam (PUH) from
sand, He was able to Create Eve also from sand, and as long it is that
way for what purpose He , the Exalted, would create her out from one of
his (PUH) ribs but to be against what the Household do say,

and what was said by the Household is what goes along with the good
thinking and would be accepted by the straight mind, and if the creation
of Eve from his ribs, after his existence and the completeness of his
creation and being breathed in and making the Angels prostrate before
him as they claim, that would require getting his rib out after falling
asleep to create Eve in something appears more like a surgery as done by
the physicians these days like cutting and pulling out stones and
opening the abdomen,

after putting under the chloroform and it is something that would make
the bereaved mother laugh, and if they meant by all that that she was
created from the remains of his mud and his sand and not his rib after
his creation, then it is as said by the Household of Muhammad the
Chosen, and so no difference, but why do they say his left rib? maybe
they meant from the his sand remains and God knows better and it is all
up to Him and no power except by Him.


**The marriage of the children of Adam (PUH)**

The marriage of the children of Adam (PUH) from each other was a matter
of a lot of controversy. Some people said that their marriage first was
in the manner of a brother with a sister marriage since Eve used to have
a male and a female at every pregnancy and the rule with them was the
marriage of the female of the next pregnancy with the male of the
previous pregnancy and vice versa and a brother was not allowed to
marriage the sister that was born with him at the same time.

Then the consideration of lawfulness and unlawfulness is not
independent of thinking itself, but it is an act of the legislator and
they are created laws, the legislator can put them up or cancel them
because he is the source of legislation, so then what is unlawful is
what God made unlawful and what is lawful is what He made lawful,

so in the beginning of this matter it was lawful for the necessity and
being among them only, but then after that it was made unlawful by God
when they turned to be numerous and there was no count in the later
religions for the necessity nor a criticizing for any difference in the
laws.

In the beginning Adam let the brother get married to his sister by a
commandment of God and it is lawful by the order of God and there should
be no abomination because the laws were issued by Him and He is the
source for them so no objection should be there from the created against
the Creator, that is if this is the case.

But what is mentioned from the Household members (PUT) is that it is
forbidden and they opposed it furiously. A questioner asked Al-Imam
Al-Sadiq (PUH) and the questioner showed that the whole creation is in
origin from brothers and sisters then said he (PUH): praise be to God,
the Exalted,

the High above all what they say, do they say that the best of God's
creation and the prophets came from a taboo and that God could not Make
them out of lawful ways? i swear by God that I've been told that some
animals did not know its sister and rided over her, then it got from
over its back and knew that it is the sister, it bit over its own
genitals until they died.

In a speech from Zorarah ben A'yon from Abi 'Abdullah Al-Sadiq (PUH) in
a long speech, he mentioned what is told about the marriage of sisters
and brothers until he said (PUH): Woe to these (who believe in the
marriage of sisters and brothers) where are they about what was agreed
on by the wisemen of Hijaz and wisemen of Iraq that God ordered the pen
and it wrote on the Kept Board [this is the board of destinies, you can
see a similar concept in other pagan religions,

like Sumerian] what is to be until the time of the doomsday and that
was before the creation of Adam (PUH) by two thousands years and the
books of God, the Exalted, were written by the pen and in all of them
there is a prohibition for the marriage of brothers and sisters, until
he said (PUH): and these are the most famous books in this world,

they are the old and new testaments, book of psalms and Al-Forqan
(Quran), they had been revealed by God from the Kept Board on His
prophets, peace on all of them, and there is no such legislation for
anything like that, and anyone said that only wanted to support the
opinions of the magians.

Then he started to explain the beginning of the race from Adam (PUH)
and his children, and that he had Qabeel (Cain) and when he grew and
been mature, God showed a faminine demon from Djinn called Johanah in
the shape of a human so when Qabeel saw her he loved her, and then God
sent to Adam to engage her to Qabeel.

Then he got Habeel (Abel) and when he grew and been mature, God
revealed a nymph [notice nymph here does not mean "mermaid", but maiden
from paradise with extra-ordinary beauty] from paradise to Adam and her
name was Nazlah, so when Habeel saw her loved her and then God sent to
Adam to engage her to Habeel and he did so. So, Nazlah the nymph was a
wife to Habeel ben Adam and Johanah the one from Djinn a wife for Qabeel
ben Adam and the race was out of them.

And Adam (PUH) had a daughter and her name was 'Enaq but she was a bad
daughter and got a son that she called 'Ewaj and he was a mighty one and
a foe for God and His faithful slaves and for every religion and Islam
and he was a giant with huge body and could take a whale with his hand
from the bottom of the sea then lift it up in the sky and grill it in
the heat of the sun and eat it then, and he lived for three thousands
and six hundreds years as been told. Then God sent someone to his mother
'Enaq daughter of Adam to kill her, and so she was killed and died after
she gave birth to 'Ewaj.

It is mentioned also that after Adam got four males, God revealed for
them four nymphs, so each one married one of them and gave birth, then
God did lift them up again, then these four married also four from Djinn
and they gave birth too, and from them all did come the race and made
numerous, so anyone that is clement it would be rooted to Adam (PUH) and
anyone with beauty then it would be rooted to the nymphs, and anyone
with ugliness or bad manners that would be rooted to the Djinn.

What is mentioned by the Household (PUT) that the children of Adam
(PUH), some of them married the nymphs and some of them married demons
and they got children, so anyone of them would be with beauty and
manners that would be from the nymphs and any one of them would be of
bad manners and ugliness that would be from the Djinn (or demons), and
anyway both tales leads to the same point.

And in a speech for Al-Sadiq (PUH) he mentions that Adam (PUH) got
birth for seventy times, in each time he gets a male and a female, until
God gave Adam Seth without any other, then when Seth grew and God wanted
to reach with the race as you see now, He revealed at the after-noon of
a Thursday a nymph from paradise that was called Nazlah,

so God ordered Adam to engage her to Seth and so he did. Then, He
revealed another nymph from paradise too at the next day's after-noon
and her name was Monazzalah, and God ordered Adam to engage her to his
son Japheth [Arabic: Yafeth] and so he did. Then Seth had a boy and
Japheth had a girl, then God ordered Adam when they grew and been mature
to let them marriage each other and so he did and she gave birth to the
chosen of prophets and messengers.

Then said Al-Imam Al-Sadiq (PUH): And woe to them who said about the
matter of the marriage of brothers and sisters, so the marriage of
Japheth and Seth with the two nymphs Nazlah and Monazzalah was for a
wisdom and a secret that was kept in the knowledge of God and only He
know it and no one else, and the brains of Adam's descendants is far
from understanding the true aspects of such things, and Man was created
as a fool. To surrender to the real thing is a must, especially if it
was beyond the abilities of human beings and can not be reached with
their thinking nor their dreams.

It is mentioned by them (PUT) also that God, the Exalted, ordered Adam
(PUH) to put the heritage of prophecy and wisdom within Habeel and teach
him about it and about whatever God ordered with and whatever God
prohibited, so then when he did that and Qabeel knew about what happened
from his father Adam toward his brother Habeel he got angry and opposed
his father and said: am I not the older than Habeel and deserve this
more than him and you should have put me before Habeel?

So he said to him: O son, the matter is not in my hands but in the
hands of God and God only made it for him and I did not do it for by my
wishes, but that was from an order from my Lord, so if you do not
believe, give a sacrifice and whoever God would accept his sacrifice
then he is the one to be chosen and receive the heritage of prophecy. At
the time, the acception of a sacrifice was to be hit by fire from heaven
and burn it, and if it is not accepted no fire would come and it won't
be burnt.

Qabeel was a man of agriculture so he sacrificed with bad wheat, and
Habeel was a shepherd and so he sacrificed with a fat sheep, then a fire
came from heaven down over the sheep of Habeel and burnt it and did not
touch the sacrifice of Qabeel, so then Qabeel got so mad and Iblis came
to him and whispered to him and said: if you had children and your race
became numerous, then for sure the children of Habeel would be proud
over your own children for accepting of the sacrifice of their father
and not accepting yours,

and that God made it special for Habeel to take the heritage of
prophecy instead of you, and that would make you with your children
worried and humiliated, and if you killed him you would cut off his
branch and relax your children from all these troubles and hardness, and
your father would not find anyone to take the heritage but you to win.

Then his soul seduced him to kill his brother and so he did. Then Iblis
the damned did say to him: the fire that accept the sacrifice and burn
it is called the Holy, so make it holy and build a house for it and make
some people to worship it so it would accept your sacrifice and the
sacrifice of everyone that worship it and be sure to worship it in a
good manner and take care of it if you want to do so. So, Qabeel did
whatever Iblis ordered him to do and so he was the first to worship the
fire and built houses for it and so he became a disbeliever in God.

He killed his brother in Basrah in the Kiblah (prayer niche) direction
of the mosque of Al-Jame', and at the day that Habeel (PUH) was killed,
his wife Nazlah the nymph was pregnant and she gave birth to a boy that
was called by his grandfather Adam (PUH) Habeel as his father's name,
and we have mentioned before that Adam got, after Habeel murder within a
time, a boy and called him Seth then Adam said this is te gift of God
[notice: Seth or Sheth means The Gift] because he was born after some
time after the murder of Habeel and after Adam stopped contacting Eve
(PUT) for his sadness upon Habeel because Habeel had a great position
towards God, and because it is the first great murder to occur on the
face of earth between his sons and children,

and when the gift of God Seth (PUH) got older and mature, we said that
God, the Exalted, sent down for Adam a nymph called Nazlah as mentioned
before in the shape of a human and God ordered him to engage her for his
son the gift of God Seth and so Adam did so and then she gave birth for
a boy from the gift of God Seth as mentioned before, then she gave birth
for a girl also from him and called her Hooriyah [meaning: a nymph] so
then God ordered him to engage her for Habeel the son of Habeel and so
he did,

and when the days of Adam (PUH) were to be over, God ordered him(Adam)
to bequeath to his son the gift of God Seth and give him the heritage of
prophecy and wisdom and ordered him to be silent and keep it a secret to
avoid his brother Qabeel to not envy him and kill him as he did with
Habeel. It is mentioned also that when Qabeel killed his brother Habeel
he did not know what to do with him so God sent two crows and they
fought together until one of them killed the other then the killer dag a
little hole with his claws and buried the killed one,

and that was just to show Qabeel how to bury his brother Habeel (PUH)
then Qabeel said what it mentioned in the Holy Quran "Woe unto me! Am I
not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse ? And
he became repentant"(Al-Ma'idah: 31) and so he dag a hole for him and
buried him. Then after he buried him Qabeel got back to his father and
his brother was not with him,

so then his father Adam (PUH) said to him: where did you leave your
brother Habeel? Then Qabeel did say to him: and dd you send me as keeper
for him? Then his father said to him and he felt the evil and what he
did with him: go with me to the place of the sacrifice and when he
reached it he knew that he was killed and Adam (PUH) showed sadness and
regret for losing him, and he got sad a lot and cried for him forty days
and nights, and his murder was at the end of the month on Wednesday and
for this Wednesdays were always days of ill-luck and in special the last
Wednesday of the month.

It was been told also that when Qabeel killed Habeel (PUH), the beasts,
lions and birds and whatever types of animals got disturbed and departed
because of their fear and every type followed its own type after they
were all mixed together and used to live with human beings and do not go
away from him, but after the son of Adam killed his brother they
departed. It has been told that the people that would be tortured the
most at the doomsday are seven persons,

the first of them is the son of Adam who killed his brother, and Nemrud
(Nimrud) who argued Abraham about his Lord and threw him in fire and two
from Israelites that made their people Jews and Christians and the
pharaoh who said I am your exalted god [meaning the pharaoh of Moses,
and it might be Ramesses II], and two from this nation [nation means
here either Islam nation or only the Arab nation].

We have mentioned before that Adam (PUH) lived for nine hundreds and
thirty years and this is the most famous and he was buried after his
death in a cave in the mount of Abi Qubays and his face towards the Holy
Kaba, and mentioned that God sent to Noah (PUH) while he was in the Ark
to go around the House for a week and so he did then God ordered him to
carry with him the corpse of his father Adam [in Arabic you can point to
the grand father of someone by father as well] to Kufa [a city in Iraq
was a capital for the Islamic rule during the rule of 'Ali ben Abi Talib
PUH],

so he got to the water and got out a tomb carrying the corpse of Adam
(PUH) and his bones and carried it in the heart of the Ark then he went
around the House as God desired then he got back until he reached the
gates of Kufa in the middle of its mosque from where did the Ark move
and from there the people departed as well as the animals, then he
(Noah) took the corpse of Adam the father of Human beings and buried it
in Kufa in Al-Najaf where lies the Prince of Believers (PUH), and where
there is the tomb of Noah himself (PUH), and everything was by order
from God and He knows everything better.

The great historian and the owner of Moruj Al-?ahab [Fields of Gold],
Al-Mas'udi, mentioned in it (the book), from the Prince of Believers
(PUH) a story related to the concept of creation and some of the
conditions of Adam (PUH) I would like to mention it here for this
occasion and for what it contains from recent facts and brightful clues
to assert the truth and refute the lies, and mentioned in it cases that
its measurement aren't doubtful,

and I did not see it in Nahj Al-Balaghah, so he said: he said (Prince
of Believers PUH) when God desired to Predestinate the creation and
Making the livings and Invent the Inventions, He made the creation in a
picture of dust, and that was before the creation of earth and lifting
of the skies, and He is in His Throne and with His own power, then He
released a part of light from His own light so it got sprinkled, and
Took out some of His own brightness and it got bright then the light
gathered in the middle of that hidden pictures and that matched the
picture of our prophet Muhammad (PUH), then God, the Exalted one,

did say: you are the Chosen and the one that keeps My light and the
treasures of My guidance, so for you I make the earth and Wave the water
and Lift up the skies, and Make the rewards and punishments, paradise
and hell, and Make your Household for guidance and Give them from My
wisdom that nothing would make troubles for them and nothing hidden
would make them tired, and Make them the rulers over My livings and the
warners for My power and My uniqueness, then God took their testaments
for Himself being a Lord, and their sincerity for Himself being One, and
before God took whatever He took over His creation,

He selected Muhammad and his Household and Showed them that guidance is
with him (the prophet) and the light is with him and the leadership in
his Household, then God hid the creation in His divination and Hid it in
the deeps of His wisdom, then Created the worlds and Waved the water and
Excited the foam and Raised the smoke, then His Throne floated upon the
water and then He made the earth upon the water's surface, then He
called them to obey and they answered, then God created the Angels from
lights that He did create and souls He did invent and combined believing
in Him being Holy One with believing in the prophecy of Muhammad (PUH)
and so it was made famous in the heavens before he was sent on earth,
and when God created Adam, He showed his virtues for the Angels and
Showed them what special wisdom he has when he was asked about the names
of things,

so He made Adam a sanctuary and a door and a qiblah [destination of the
prayer's face] to which He made the faithful and spiritual and the
lights prostrate towards, then He warned Adam for His secret and Showed
him the seriousness of what He made it a fidelity for him after He
called him an Imam (leader) among the Angels, so his luck of goodness
was for what did he carry from our lights, and still God did hide this
light by time until it appeared with the prophet Muhammad (PUH) and he
invited people in secret and in public,

and he (the prophet PUH) recalled back for the keeping of the testament
that he gave in the world of atoms before coming into a being, so
whoever went along with him and took from the lamp of light that is
given would be guided to his path and would be clear on his matter, and
whoever been fooled deserved the anger,

then the light transferred to our senses and got brightened in our
Imams, so we are the lights of heavens and lights of earth, so with us
the safety and from us the secrets of wisdom and for us the endings of
matters, and with our Mahdi the leadership would be over, the last of
Imams and the saviour of the nation and the source of issues, so we are
the best of the creation and the most honest believers and the leaders
by the commandment of God, so let him be in grace who believes in us.
Finished what Al-Mas'udi transferred from the master of Believers the
prince of Believers (PUH)

Then said Al-Mas'udi in Muruj Al-?ahab, page twenty three, part one,
published by Dar Al-Raja', Baghdad, this is what was mentioned by Abi
Abdullah Jafar ben Muhammad from his father Muhammad ben 'Ali from his
father 'Ali ben Al-Husain from his father Al-Husain ben 'Ali from the
Prince of Believers 'Ali ben Abi Talib (PUH), over. Then said
Al-Mas'udi: what is found in the old testament (Torah) is that God
started the creation on Monday and finished in Saturday and for this
they had Saturday for a holiday, and people of the new testament
(Injeel) claimed that Messiah (PUH) stood up from his grave on Sunday so
they had this day as a holiday.

[seems the emphasis on this paragraph is put here because Al-Mas'udi is
a Sunnite scholar and is put here as a clue from a sunnite book on the
value and level of the Household of the prophet Muhammad, which is
something denied by the creed of Sunnites. But also I might be mistaken
with that.]

And what is believed by the public, from scholars and tracers, is that
the starting was on Sunday and the ending was on Friday and in it the
soul was breathed into Adam and it is the sixth od April, then Eve was
created from Adam, and lived in paradise for three hours of that day, so
they stayed for three hours and it is the quarter of a day by two
hundreds and fifty years from this life's years, and Adam was down on
Sarandeeb (Ceylon),

and Eve in Jeddah, and Iblis in Bisan [might be a city in Turkey or
Iran], and the snake in Asbahan (Asfahan). So Adam fell down in India on
the island of Sarandeeb on the mount of Rahoon (?), and on him the
leaves that he covered himself with from the trees of paradise, so it
got dry and the wind sprinkled it and spreaded it over India, so it is
said and God only knows, this is why the good scents and perfumes are
brought from the land of India, because of these leaves.

Then said Al-Mas'udi: when Adam fell down from paradise he got out of
it with a packet of wheat and thirty rods from paradise trees, carrying
several types of fruits, ten of them from these who have a shell and
they are: Walnut, Almonds, Hazel, Pistachio, Poppy, Chestnut, Bitter
orange, Pomegranate, Banana, and Oak, and ten of them from these who
have a pulp and they are: Peach, Apricot, Plum, Date, Mountain ash, Nabk
(lotus jujube),

Hawthorn, Jujube, (balsamadendron africanum) [could not find the
translation for this word at all],and wild plum, and from these who have
no shell nor pulp, and they are ten also: Apple, Quince, Grape, Pear,
Fig, Raspberry, Citron, Snake cucumber, Cucumber, and carob. Then he
said: it is said that when Adam and Eve fell down from paradise, they
fell apart, so then they met each other in the position called 'Arafah
and for this meeting this position was called like that.

He mentioned also that people of the Book [meaning Christians and Jews]
claimed that Adam engaged the sister of Habeel to Qabeel and the sister
of Qabeel to Habeel and differentiated in marriage between two
pregnancies, then he said: and Magians claimed that Adam did not refuse
the marriage between two pregnancies and he did not check about it and
they have for this a poem claiming in it the virtue and goodness in
engaging a brother to his sister and the mother to her son..etc.

Al-Mas'udi showed also some matters about Habeel and Qabeel and
investigated about it, until he said: it is said that he killed him in a
desert, and it had been told that that was in Damascus in Syria, and he
killed him by injuring with a stone, until he said: when he killed him,
he got buffled and did not know what to do with the body, so he carried
him and walked across the lands then God sent a crow (raven) to another
crow so it killed the other and burried him, so Qabeel regretted and
said what the Quran did say about him "Woe unto me! Am I not able to be
as this raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse?" then he burried
him, so when Adam knew about it he got sad, afraid and frightened ...
etc.

Then he said in Muruj Al-?ahab: Then God inspired to him (to Adam) I'm
going to extract from you My light that is the guide in the pure
worshipping and the honourable stumps of trees, and I will make it the
one with pride among all the lights and Make him the end of prophets and
Make his Household the best of leaders and viceroys and I will make the
end of time by their end and Full up the earth with their allegation and
Spread it among their followers so stand up,

tuck and purify yourself, sanctify and praise and go to your wife and
she is clean because My deposit will be transferred from you to the boy
coming from both of you, so Adam did it with Eve so she became pregnant
at the same time and her forehead got shone and the light got brightened
from her eyes until her pregnancy was over she had give birth to a
breeze like the finest of all the males and most respectful and
prettiest in shape and most complete in his look-likes and fairly
created, accompanied by light and dignity, covered with pride and
majesty, and so the light transferred from Eve to him so it was
brightened in his forehead and rose in his face,

so then Adam called him Seth the gift of God, and so until he got
older, Adam did give him the heritage and told him the responsibilities
upon him and told him that he is a leader by God after him and His
viceroy on earth and the doer for the rights for God, and he is the
second transmission for the Holy Nucleus (Atom). Until Al-Mas'udi said:
and Adam did appoint Seth over his(Adam) kids and it is said that Adam
died after having forty thousands of his children and grand children,
until he said: Seth did rule the people and legislated by his father's
Books and by what was revealed upon him from books and laws.

Then Seth gave the heritage to his son Anush and told him about the
deposit and told him the honour of this deposit and that it is their
honour. Then told him also to warn his children one after the other
about this honour and let everyone of them give its heritage to his
descendants and make it among them as a will(testament) transferring as
long as the race did exist.

So the will kept on moving from century to century until God gave the
light to 'Abdul-Mottalib and his son 'Abdullah the father of the prophet
of God (PUH) then he said: At this position the people of creeds did
differ, and some of them believed in ascribing and some of them believed
in selection. These who believe in ascribing are Abadhites (it is a band
from Al-Khawarij) [Al-Khawarij, people popped up on the surface during
the war between 'Ali ben Abi Talib PUH and the prince of Umayya,
Mo'awiyah in Syria upon the leadership of the Islamic nation.

They believed that the rule should be to God without any need to have a
viceroy nor a prince, nor 'Ali nor Mo'awiyah] and they are the followers
of 'Abdullah ben Abadh Al-Tamimi as mentioned in Majma' Al-Bahrain for
Al-Torayhi [a book's name], and the people of Imamism from the followers
of 'Ali ben Abi Talib (PUH) and the purified from his descendants who
mentioned that God never left an era of time without a man that rule by
God's commandments either a prophet or a viceroy appointed by God's
prophets and viceroys by names and description.

And the people of selection are some scholars and Al-Mo'tazala [people
of some creed] and some bands of Al-Khawarij and Al-Morji'ah [a band
that do not judge on anyone but leave it to be on Doomsday], and lot of
the people of Hadith and public, and some bands from Al-Zaydiyah [a band
of Shiites that believe in Zayd ben 'Ali ben Al-Husain, the grandson of
'Ali ben Abi Talib PUH, to be an Imam and a leader or caliphate. Still
common in Yemen], so all of these claimed that God and His prophet
appointed to the nation to select their leaders, and some eras might
have no viceroy doing the commandments of God, and it is the protected
Imam for the Shiites.

He mentioned that Seth (PUH) is the source of the race after Adam (PUH)
among all his children. And at the time of Anush the son of Seth, Qabeel
which is called by a lot of people as Qayen [that is Cain] was killed,
and Al-Mas'udi always mentions his name as Qayen the son of Adam, and he
is the killer of his brother Habeel (PUH).

Anush did live for nine hundreds and sixty years. Anush did have a kid
called Qaynan (Cainan) and died when he was nine hundreds and twenty
years old, and they say his death was in July after he got a son called
Mahla'eel (Mahalaleel) and he did live for eight hundred years and he
had a son called Lud and the light is inherited and the testament is
taken. And Al-Mas'udi said: it is said that lot of diversions were
founded at the time of Lud, founded by the descendants of Qayen (Qabeel)
and he is the killer of his brother Habeel.

There were wars between the descendants of Lud and Qayen and stories,
all were mentioned in the book of Al-Mas'udi "Akhbar Al-Zaman" [i.e.
Tidings of Time], and also there were wars between the children of Seth
and their mates from the children of Qayen, then he said: and most of
this race [maybe he means the race of Cain] is in India, and the life of
Lud the son of Mahalaleel expanded for seven hundreds and thirty two
years and died on March,

and after him came his son Akhnukh and he is Edrees [i.e Enoch] the
prophet may peace be upon him and his fathers the purified and his
children the chosen from prophets and viceroys, and the Sabaeans believe
he is Hermes (and it means) Mercury, and he is what God said about in
his holy Book "And We raised him to high station"(Maryam: 57) and he was
the first to sew and stitch. And God revealed on him thirty pages, and
Adam (PUH) got twenty one pages before,

and on Seth it was revealed twenty nine pages contained the praising
and sanctifying, and after Enoch comes his son Matushaleh [i.e.
Methuselah] so he built up the lands and the light in his forehead and
he got children and people did talk a lot about his children and they
say that Russians and Slavs are from his children and his life was for
nine hundreds and sixty years and died in September, and after him came
his son Lamak [i.e. Lamech] and during his days there were accidents and
lot of differences and died after seven hundreds and ninety years..etc
what is mentioned by Al-Mas'udi we copied it by sentences for a time and
by summary at another and God is the Good Donor and He is the Knower of
all matters.
