Lesson 2 : Proofs About the Existence of God
============================================

Burhan (Proof) is a powerful tool of explanation. It helps to clarify
important concepts and removes doubts. So far we have talked about two
different kinds of proof about the existence of God.

i)Burhani Nazm (Proof of Systematical Creation) - we have discussed
this in the previous books when we looked at the solar system and the
water cycle.

ii) Burhani Eliyyat (Proof of Cause and Effect) - which we have talked
about in the previous chapter. Let us now compare these two proofs.

**1. BURHANI NAZM (Systematic Proof)**

This proof is based on the systematic way that the universe is formed.
When we observe the world around us, we find that there is an order to
the way every component of it works. Each part is related to the other
in some way to form a whole.

There is absolute co-ordination between all the areas. From this
perfect co-operation within the system, we can deduce that there is one
power that possesses all the knowledge required to establish this
organised system i.e. Nazm.

Therefore, we can further conclude that the universe is created by an
Almighty God, Who has absolute control over it. According to this proof,
we can clearly see that Maker of the worlds is one who is All Aware. The
result is this uniquely designed system that is governing the whole
universe.

**2. BURHANI ILIYYAT (Proof of Cause and Effect)**

In the previous lesson, we looked at the universe, not as a whole but
in its separate parts. We tried to look at the components of world we
live in not as fractions of a whole but as existing entities in
themselves.

From our discussion, we concluded that nothing is self-existent and
every thing requires a cause. All things need what we call Ellat
(Cause). We then said that as this world is a collection of existences
or Effects, so naturally they must be the result of a Cause.

The proof of Iliyyat is based on this. Since the world itself is a
collection of complex existences, there can be no doubt that it needs a
very great source for its own existence. That great power is Allah
(S.W.T.).

Both Burhani Nazm and Burhani Iliyyat are supposed to clear our minds
and awaken our hearts to the realities that surround us. By pondering
upon these proofs, we strengthen our own Imaan in the Almighty God.

It is in the Fitrah (Nature) of human beings to be aware of the
existence of the Almighty. Those who seek to further intensify their
faith rise to the heights of Yaqeen (Certainty) about Him. The issue
then becomes so clear in their eyes, that they no longer require any
proof about the existence of God.

In all difficulties, they seek refuge in Him, knowing that their very
existence depends upon Him. They never lose hope or experience fear
because they know every other creation, however powerful it may seem,
needs Allah (S.W.T.) to be and is under His Command and Iraadah (Will).
Such people do not bow down in front of anyone except the Almighty. They
do not accept the superiority or wilaaya of anyone but those from God.

A Holy Verse
"Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who brought them
into existence." Sura Ambiya, Verse 56

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT…**

1. Burhani Nazm states that the world is a systematic creation working
in perfect harmony. The source of such a system should be a supreme,
powerful, knowledgeable and mighty God.

2. Burhan Illiyat defines the fact that everything has a cause and an
effect. This universe is an effect and every effect needs a cause
therefore the cause must be a magnificent, absolute entity i.e. the
Almighty (S.W.T.)

3. Those who are truly aware of the Creator are so certain in their
faith that they do not need proof of His existence.

**Think And Answer**

What does proof mean? When is it used? So far how many proofs do you
have on the existence of God? Explain the proof of designed system in
your own words. Explain the proof of cause and effect in your own
words.

Why do we need to prove the existence of God? Does the human being with
a pure nature need any proof about God? Explain your answer.

**Introduction to Chapter Two**

In The Name Of Allah (S.W.T.), the Beneficent, the Merciful

**MA'AD
The Life in the Hereafter**

In our previous discussions, we have tried to study the reason for the
creation of human beings. We have seen that nothing in this world was
created without an aim and we also discussed a little about the Day of
Judgment. Let us now look deeper into the philosophy of Ma'ad.

The Day of Judgment is a day of Accountability. During the course of
this chapter, we will learn about Paradise and Hell. When we study what
we know of Jannah (Heavens) we can appreciate the marvels and favors of
Allah (S.W.T.) upon His obedient servants. We can also learn of the
plight of the dwellers of Hell who will receive Allah (S.W.T.)'s severe
punishment. We know that all this results from the deeds we perform in
this world. The choice of eternal bliss or eternal punishment is ours.

The aim of studying these important issues is to create an internal
awareness, a sort of alarm bell in our minds that will encourage us to
think of the results of our present actions and help us to stay on the
Right Path.


**Lesson 3: Qiyamah (A Day Of Judgement and Accountability)**

Let us reflect on the verses of Sura Naba (The Great Event) from the
Holy Qur'an: In the Name of Allah, the Most Kind, the Merciful

1. Of what do they ask one another?
2. About the great event
3. About which they differ?
4. Nay! Nay! They shall soon know;
5. Nay! Nay! They shall soon know;
6. Have We not made the earth an even expanse?
7. And the mountains as projections (thereof)?
8. And We created you in pairs,
9. And We made your sleep to be rest (for you)
10. And We made the night to be a covering
11. And We made the day for seeking livelihood
12. And We built over you seven strong (heavens)
13. And We made a shining lamp
14. And We send down from the clouds water pouring forth abundantly,
15. That We may bring forth thereby corn and herbs,
16. And gardens dense and luxurious

These beginning verses of Sura Naba (The Great Event) speak of the
wonderful creations of Allah (S.W.T.) i.e. the heavens, earth, universe,
the rise of day and fall of the night, rain, water, plants, trees etc.
From these descriptions, we are reminded of His favours on us. We also
realize how grateful we must be to Him. The surah then continues on a
different subject:

Surely the Day of Decision is (a day) appointed: The day on which the
trumpet shall be blown so you shall come forth in hosts,

And the heaven shall be opened so that it shall be all opening, And the
mountains shall be moved off so that they shall remain a mere semblance
(of what they were).

Allah (S.W.T.) has given great emphasis on the appointed Day of
Judgment. He keeps reminding us that He created human beings with an aim
and that we will one day have to answer for our success in pursuing and
achieving this goal. The final verses of the surah deal with Jannah and
Jahannam:

Surely hell lies in wait,
A home for the rebellious,
They will live therein for ages
They shall not taste therein coolness nor drink
But boiling and intensely cold water,
Requital corresponding (to their evil deeds).
Surely they feared not the account,
And called Our communications a lie, giving the lie (to the truth)
And We have recorded everything in a book,
So taste (that which you have earned)! For We will not add to you
aught
but chastisement,
Surely for those who guard (against evil) is achievement,
Gardens and vineyards,
And those showing freshness of youth, equals in age,
And a pure cup,
They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying.
A reward from your Lord, a gift according to a reckoning:
Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the
Beneficent God, with Whom none can converse.
On the day when the spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks; they
shall
not speak except he whom the Beneficent permits and who speaks the
right thing.
That is the sure day; so whoever desires may take refuge with his
lord.
Surely We have warned you of a chastisement near at hand, the day when
man shall see what his two hands have sent before him and the unbeliever
shall say: 'O! Would that I were dust!'
We know for a fact that those who have obeyed the commands of Allah
(S.W.T.) and performed good actions will witness a happy ending in the
hereafter. Those who have strayed from the right path and have disobeyed
the Islamic commands will indeed face a miserable ending. The doers of
good and evil will be separated from each other and each group will be
given the recompense they justly deserve.

A human being has to understand and analyze his purpose of life. This
will increase the value of the blessing that is life and will inspire
him to make the most of it in perfecting himself. Volumes of traditions,
sayings and comments have discussed the reality of the Day of Judgment
and the Ma'soomeen (a.s.) have warned mankind of the severity of
disbelief and choosing the path of damnation.

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) has said:

" Four things will be questioned on the Day of Judgment:

1.How a person spent his life 2.How he utilised his physical body for
the sake of Allah (S.W.T.) and Islam.

3.In what manner a person attained his wealth and how he used it.

4.Love of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) and his pure family (household)."

In another hadith, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) says: " Whosoever hurts
another human being, even if it were with a physical stick, will be
beaten in the same manner, on the Day of Judgment." He has also said:

" I swear by Allah (S.W.T.), punishment in the hereafter is more
severer than the calamities of this world."

The Day of Qiyamah will truly be a trying time. All people will rise up
and stand in front of the Almighty for the accountability of their
deeds. A man will complain about issues concerning his personal life
e.g. concerning his wife and if she tries to deny the truth, the angels
will seal her mouth, so that she cannot speak and instead her limbs will
bear witness to her actions.

Likewise, if a wife complains on that day, lamenting to the Lord: "My
husband used to burn the house with his rage" then the body parts of the
man will bear witness against him if her claim is true.

It will be a day of ultimate Justice and all will be faced with their
actions in this world. Those who usurped the rights of the others and
oppressors will have to face a similar fate as that which they inflicted
upon the innocent.

Our Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) is a Mercy to the Universe and he does not
wish for any single soul to be punished in the hereafter. Yet, he has
reminded us over and over again of the reality that we will have to
face. In one of his hadith, he says: "God! Show mercy upon the people
who have usurped the rights of others before they depart from this
world. May they fulfill the dues they have taken from the oppressed and
seek forgiveness for their actions. For on the Day of Judgment, there
will be no money debts, only actions will speak (either good or bad) and
accompany human beings.

"If a person does not have any good actions, he will indeed face bitter
consequences and will be answerable on that great Day. It will be the
Day that will advocate true Justice, none will be able to speak against
the Justice. Only Truth shall prevail. For the true believers there is
no choice except to attain taqwa." Our Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w.) then
warned Believers to give utmost importance to:

**(a) Salaat (Prayers)**
**(b) Akhlaq (Moral Excellence)**

Although we know that each individual is accountable for his actions,
we must realise that our perception is flawed and refrain from judging
others. Our vigilance should concern only our own actions and not that
of others. For them Allah (S.W.T.) is Judge as He is for us. The Holy
Prophet (s.a.w.w.) told us: "Account yourselves before you account
others."

A Holy Verse
"O Dawood! Surely We have made you a ruler in the land; so judge
between men with justice and do not follow desire, lest it should lead
you astray from the path of Allah; those who go astray from the path of
Allah, they shall surely have a severe punishment because they forgot
the Day of Reckoning." Sura Su'ad, Verse 26

**SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT…**

1. A human being has been created with a purpose in life. He has been
created for a holy aim and through this aim he will be able to achieve
salvation in both this and the next world.

2. Qiyamat is a Day of Accountability for all actions. Human beings
will be judged according to their deeds. The pious will enjoy Jannah
(Garden of Bliss). Sadly, a Kafir (disbeliever) will not even smell the
scent of paradise but will be banished to never ending punishment in
Jahannam.

3. People will complain about each other on the Day of Judgment.
However, the accused will not be allowed to speak and instead the parts
of his body will be witness to his actions. No one will bear the burden
of another and no soul shall be able to deceive or cover his misdeeds

4. Allah (S.W.T.) will bestow the rights of the oppressed on them and
allow them to avenge their oppressors of this world.
