PREFACE
=======

In the tenth book of the “Republic”, when Plato has completed his final
burning denunciation of Poetry, the false Siren, the imitator of things
which themselves are shadows, the ally of all that is low and weak in
the soul against that which is high and strong, who makes us feed the
things we ought to starve and serve the things we ought to rule, he ends
with a touch of compunction: 'We will give her champions, not poets
themselves but poet-lovers, an opportunity to make her defence in plain
prose and show that she is not only sweet--as we well know--but also
helpful to society and the life of man, and we will listen in a kindly
spirit.  For we shall be gainers, I take it, if this can be proved.'
Aristotle certainly knew the passage, and it looks as if his treatise on
poetry was an answer to Plato's challenge.

Few of the great works of ancient Greek literature are easy reading.
They nearly all need study and comment, and at times help from a good
teacher, before they yield up their secret.  And the \_Poetics\_ cannot
be accounted an exception.  For one thing the treatise is fragmentary.
It originally consisted of two books, one dealing with Tragedy and Epic,
the other with Comedy and other subjects.  We possess only the first.
For another, even the book we have seems to be unrevised and
unfinished.  The style, though luminous, vivid, and in its broader
division systematic, is not that of a book intended for publication.
Like most of Aristotle's extant writing, it suggests the MS. of an
experienced lecturer, full of jottings and adscripts, with occasional
phrases written carefully out, but never revised as a whole for the
general reader.  Even to accomplished scholars the meaning is often
obscure, as may be seen by a comparison of the three editions recently
published in England, all the work of savants of the first eminence,[^1]
or, still more strikingly, by a study of the long series of
misunderstandings and overstatements and corrections which form the
history of the \_Poetics\_ since the Renaissance.

But it is of another cause of misunderstanding that I wish principally
to speak in this preface.  The great edition from which the present
translation is taken was the fruit of prolonged study by one of the
greatest Aristotelians of the nineteenth century, and is itself a
classic among works of scholarship.  In the hands of a student who knows
even a little Greek, the translation, backed by the commentary, may lead
deep into the mind of Aristotle.  But when the translation is used, as
it doubtless will be, by readers who are quite without the clue provided
by a knowledge of the general habits of the Greek language, there must
arise a number of new difficulties or misconceptions.

To understand a great foreign book by means of a translation is possible
enough where the two languages concerned operate with a common stock of
ideas, and belong to the same period of civilization.  But between
ancient Greece and modern England there yawn immense gulfs of human
history; the establishment and the partial failure of a common European
religion, the barbarian invasions, the feudal system, the regrouping of
modern Europe, the age of mechanical invention, and the industrial
revolution.  In an average page of French or German philosophy nearly
all the nouns can be translated directly into exact equivalents in
English; but in Greek that is not so.  Scarcely one in ten of the nouns
on the first few pages of the \_Poetics\_ has

an exact English equivalent.  Every proposition has to be reduced to its
lowest terms of thought and then re-built.  This is a difficulty which
no translation can quite deal with; it must be left to a teacher who
knows Greek.  And there is a kindred difficulty which flows from it.
Where words can be translated into equivalent words, the style of an
original can be closely followed; but no translation which aims at being
written in normal English can reproduce the style of Aristotle.  I have
sometimes played with the idea that a ruthlessly literal translation,
helped out by bold punctuation, might be the best.  For instance,
premising that the words \_poesis\_, \_poetes\_ mean originally 'making'
and 'maker', one might translate the first paragraph of the \_Poetics\_
thus:--

MAKING: kinds of making: function of each, and how the Myths ought to be
put together if the Making is to go right.

Number of parts: nature of parts: rest of same inquiry.

Begin in order of nature from first principles.

Epos-making, tragedy-making (also comedy), dithyramb-making (and most
fluting and harping), taken as a whole, are really not Makings but
Imitations.  They differ in three points; they imitate (a) different
objects, (b) by different means, (c) differently (i.e. different
manner).

Some artists imitate (i.e. depict) by shapes and colours.  (Obs.
Sometimes by art, sometimes by habit.)  Some by voice.  Similarly the
above arts all imitate by rhythm, language, and tune, and these either

(1) separate or (2) mixed.

Rhythm and tune alone, harping, fluting, and other arts with same
effect--e.g. panpipes.

Rhythm without tune: dancing.  (Dancers imitate characters, emotions,
and experiences by means of rhythms expressed in form.)

Language alone (whether prose or verse, and one form of verse or many):
this art has no name up to the present (i.e. there is no name to cover
mimes and dialogues and any similar imitation made in iambics, elegiacs,
&c.  Commonly people attach the 'making' to the metre and say
'elegiac-makers', 'hexameter-makers,' giving them a common class-name by
their metre, as if it was not their imitation that makes them 'makers').

Such an experiment would doubtless be a little absurd, but it would give
an English reader some help in understanding both Aristotle's style and
his meaning.

For example, there i.e.lightenment in the literal phrase, 'how the myths
ought to be put together.'  The higher Greek poetry did not make up
fictitious plots; its business was to express the heroic saga, the
myths.  Again, the literal translation of \_poetes\_, poet, as 'maker',
helps to explain a term that otherwise seems a puzzle in the
\_Poetics\_.  If we wonder why Aristotle, and Plato before him, should
lay such stress on the theory that art is imitation, it is a help to
realize that common language called it 'making', and it was clearly not
'making' in the ordinary sense.  The poet who was 'maker' of a Fall of
Troy clearly did not make the real Fall of Troy.  He made an imitation
Fall of Troy.  An artist who 'painted Pericles' really 'made an
imitation Pericles by means of shapes and colours'.  Hence we get
started upon a theory of art which, whether finally satisfactory or not,
is of

immense importance, and are saved from the error of complaining that
Aristotle did not understand the 'creative power' of art.

As a rule, no doubt, the difficulty, even though merely verbal, lies
beyond the reach of so simple a tool as literal translation.  To say
that tragedy 'imitate.g.od men' while comedy 'imitates bad men' strikes
a modern reader as almost meaningless.  The truth is that neither 'good'
nor 'bad' is an exact equivalent of the Greek.  It would be nearer
perhaps to say that, relatively speaking, you look up to the characters
of tragedy, and down upon those of comedy.  High or low, serious or
trivial, many other pairs of words would have to be called in, in order
to cover the wide range of the common Greek words.  And the point is
important, because we have to consider whether in Chapter VI Aristotle
really lays it down that tragedy, so far from being the story of
un-happiness that we think it, is properly an imitation of
\_eudaimonia\_--a word often translated 'happiness', but meaning
something more like 'high life' or 'blessedness'.[^2]

Another difficult word which constantly recurs in the \_Poetics\_ is
\_prattein\_ or \_praxis\_, generally translated 'to act' or 'action'.
But \_prattein\_, like our 'do', also has an intransitive meaning 'to
fare' either well or ill; and Professor Margoliouth has pointed out that
it seems more true to say that tragedy shows how men 'fare' than how
they 'act'.  It shows thei.e.periences or fortunes rather than merely
their deeds.  But one must not draw the line too bluntly.  I should
doubt whether a classical Greek writer was ordinarily conscious of the
distinction between the two meanings.  Certainly it i.e.sier to regard
happiness as a way of faring than as a form of action.  Yet Aristotle
can use the passive of \_prattein\_ for things 'done' or 'gone through'
(e.g. 52a, 22, 29: 55a, 25).

The fact is that much misunderstanding is often caused by our modern
attempts to limit too strictly the meaning of a Greek word.  Greek was
very much a live language, and a language still unconscious of grammar,
not, like ours, dominated by definitions and trained upon dictionaries.
An instance is provided by Aristotle's famous saying that the typical
tragic hero is one who falls from high state or fame, not through vice
or depravity, but by some great \_hamartia\_.  \_Hamartia\_ means
originally a 'bad shot' or 'error', but is currently used for 'offence'
or 'sin'.  Aristotle clearly means that the typical hero is a great man
with 'something wrong' in his life or character; but I think it is a
mistake of method to argue whether he means 'an intellectual error' or
'a moral flaw'.  The word is not so precise.

Similarly, when Aristotle says that a deed of strife or disaster is more
tragic when it occurs 'amid affections' or 'among people who love each
other', no doubt the phrase, as Aristotle's own examples show, would
primarily suggest to a Greek feuds between near relations.  Yet some of
the meaning is lost if one translates simply 'within the family'.

There is another series of obscurities or confusions in the \_Poetics\_
which, unless I am mistaken, arises from the fact that Aristotle was
writing at a time when the great age of Greek tragedy was long past, and
was using language formed in previous generations.  The words and
phrases remained in the tradition, but the forms of art and activity
which they denoted had sometimes changed in the interval.  If we date
the \_Poetics\_ about the year

330 B.C., as seems probable, that is more than two hundred years after
the first tragedy of Thespis was produced in Athens, and more than
seventy after the death of the last great masters of the tragic stage.
When we remember that a training in music and poetry formed a prominent
part of the education of every wellborn Athenian, we cannot be surprised
at finding in Aristotle, and to a less extent in Plato, considerable
traces of a tradition of technical language and even of aesthetic
theory.

It is doubtless one of Aristotle's great services that he conceived so
clearly the truth that literature is a thing that grows and has a
history.  But no writer, certainly no ancient writer, is always
vigilant.  Sometimes Aristotle analyses his terms, but very often he
takes them for granted; and in the latter case, I think, he is sometimes
deceived by them.  Thus there seem to be cases where he has been
affected in his conceptions of fifth-century tragedy by the practice of
his own day, when the only living form of drama was the New Comedy.

For example, as we have noticed above, true Tragedy had always taken its
material from the sacred myths, or heroic sagas, which to the classical
Greek constituted history.  But the New Comedy was in the habit of
inventing its plots.  Consequently Aristotle falls into using the word
\_mythos\_ practically in the sense of 'plot', and writing otherwise in
a way that is unsuited to the tragedy of the fifth century.  He says
that tragedy adheres to 'the historical names' for an aesthetic reason,
because what has happened is obviously possible and therefore
convincing.  The real reason was that the drama and the myth were simply
two different expressions of the same religious kernel (p.44) .  Again,
he says of the Chorus (p.  65) that it should be an integral part of the
play, which is true; but he also says that it' should be regarded as one
of the actors', which shows to what an extent the Chorus in his day was
dead and its technique forgotten.  He had lost the sense of what the
Chorus was in the hands of the great masters, say in the Bacchae or the
Eumenides.  He mistakes, again, the use of that epiphany of a God which
is frequent at the end of the single plays of Euripides, and which seems
to have been equally so at the end of the trilogies of Aeschylus.
Having lost the living tradition, he sees neither the ritual origin nor
the dramatic value of these divine epiphanies.  He thinks of the
convenient gods and abstractions who sometimes spoke the prologues of
the New Comedy, and imagines that the God appears in order to unravel
the plot.  As a matter of fact, in one play which he often quotes, the
\_Iphigenia Taurica\_, the plot is actually distorted at the very end in
order to give an opportunity for the epiphany.[^3]

One can see the effect of the tradition also in his treatment of the
terms Anagnorisis and Peripeteia, which Professor Bywater translates as
'Discovery and Peripety' and Professor Butcher as 'Recognition and
Reversal of Fortune'.  Aristotle assumes that these two elements are
normally present in any tragedy, except those which he calls 'simple';
we may say, roughly, in any tragedy that really has a plot.  This
strikes a modern reader as a very arbitrary assumption.  Reversals of
Fortune of some sort are perhaps usual in any varied plot, but surely
not Recognitions?  The clue to the puzzle lies, it can scarcely be
doubted, in the historical origin of

tragedy.  Tragedy, according to Greek tradition, is originally the
ritual play of Dionysus, performed at his festival, and representing, as
Herodotus tells us, the 'sufferings' or 'passion' of that God.  We are
never directly told what these 'sufferings' were which were so
represented; but Herodotus remarks that he found in Egypt a ritual that
was 'in almost all points the same'.[^4] This was the well-known ritual
of Osiris, in which the god was torn in pieces, lamented, searched for,
discovered or recognized, and the mourning by a sudden Reversal turned
into joy.  In any tragedy which still retained the stamp of its
Dionysiac origin, this Discovery and Peripety might normally be expected
to occur, and to occur together.  I have tried to show elsewhere how
many of our extant tragedies do, as a matter of fact, show the marks of
this ritual.[^5]

I hope it is not rash to surmise that the much-debated word
\_\_katharsis\_\_, 'purification' or 'purgation', may have come into
Aristotle's mouth from the same source.  It has all the appearance of
being an old word which is accepted and re-interpreted by Aristotle
rather than a word freely chosen by him to denote the exact phenomenon
he wishes to describe.  At any rate the Dionysus ritual itself was a
\_katharmos\_ or \_katharsis\_--a purification of the community from the
taints and poisons of the past year, the old contagion of sin and
death.  And the words of Aristotle's definition of tragedy in Chapter VI
might have been used in the days of Thespis in a much cruder and less
metaphorical sense.  According to primitive ideas, the mimic
representation on the stage of 'incidents arousing pity and fear' did
act as a \_katharsis\_ of such 'passions' or 'sufferings' in real life.
(For the word \_pathemata\_ means 'sufferings' as well as 'passions'.)
It is worth remembering that in the year 361 B.C., during Aristotle's
lifetime, Greek tragedies were introduced into Rome, not on artistic but
on superstitious grounds, as a \_katharmos\_ against a pestilence (Livy
vii.  2).  One cannot but suspect that in his account of the purpose of
tragedy Aristotle may be using an old traditional formula, and
consciously or unconsciously investing it with a new meaning, much as he
has done with the word \_mythos\_.

Apart from these historical causes of misunderstanding, a good teacher
who uses this book with a class will hardly fail to point out numerous
points on which two equally good Greek scholars may well differ in the
mere interpretation of the words.  What, for instance, are the 'two
natural causes' in Chapter IV which have given birth to Poetry?  Are
they, as our translator takes them, (1) that man is imitative, and (2)
that people delight in imitations?  Or are they (1) that man is
imitative and people delight in imitations, and (2) the instinct for
rhythm, as Professor Butcher prefers?  Is it a 'creature' a thousand
miles long, or a 'picture' a thousand miles long which raises some
trouble in Chapter VII?  The word \_zoon\_ means equally 'picture' and
'animal'.  Did the older poets make their characters speak like
'statesmen', \_politikoi\_, or merely like ordinary citizens,
\_politai\_, while the moderns made theirs like 'professors of
rhetoric'?  (Chapter VI, p. 38; cf.  Margoliouth's note and glossary).

It may seem as if the large uncertainties which we have indicated
detract in a ruinous manner from the value of the \_Poetics\_ to us as a
work of criticism.  Certainly if any young writer took this book as a
manual of rules

by which to 'commence poet', he would find himself embarrassed.  But, if
the book is properly read, not as a dogmatic text-book but as a first
attempt, made by a man of astounding genius, to build up in the region
of creative art a rational order like that which he established in
logic, rhetoric, ethics, politics, physics, psychology, and almost every
department of knowledge that existed in his day, then the uncertainties
become rather a help than a discouragement.  The.g.ve us occasion to
think and use our imagination.  They make us, to the best of our powers,
try really to follow and criticize closely the bold gropings of an
extraordinary thinker; and it is in this process, and not in any mere
collection of dogmatic results, that we shall find the true value and
beauty of the \_Poetics\_.

The book is of permanent value as a mere intellectual achievement; as a
store of information about Greek literature; and as an original or
first-hand statement of what we may call the classical view of artistic
criticism.  It does not regard poetry as a matter of unanalysed
inspiration; it makes no concession to personal whims or fashion or
\_ennui\_.  It tries by rational methods to find out what is good in art
and what makes it good, accepting the belief that there is just as truly
a good way, and many bad ways, in poetry as in morals or in playing
billiards.  This is no place to try to sum up its main conclusions.  But
it is characteristic of the classical view that Aristotle lays his
greatest stress, first, on the need for Unity in the work of art, the
need that each part should subserve the whole, while irrelevancies,
however brilliant in themselves, should be cast away; and next, on the
demand that great art must have for its subject the great way of
living.  These judgements have often been misunderstood, but the truth
in them is profound and goes near to the heart of things.

Characteristic, too, is the observation that different kinds of art grow
and develop, but not indefinitely; they develop until they 'attain their
natural form'; also the rule that each form of art should produce 'not
every sort of pleasure but its proper pleasure'; and the sober language
in which Aristotle, instead of speaking about the sequence of events in
a tragedy being 'inevitable', as we bombastic moderns do, merely
recommends that they should be 'either necessary or probable' and
'appear to happen because of one another'.

Conceptions and attitudes of mind such as these constitute what we may
call the classical faith in matters of art and poetry; a faith which is
never perhaps fully accepted in any age, yet, unlike others, is never
forgotten but lives by being constantly criticized, re-asserted, and
rebelled against.  For the fashions of the ages vary in this direction
and that, but they vary for the most part from a central road which was
struck out by the imagination of Greece.
