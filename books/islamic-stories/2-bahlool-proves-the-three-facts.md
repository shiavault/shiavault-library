Bahlool Proves the Three Facts
==============================

Abu Hanifa was once teaching Islamic beliefs to his students. He was
arguing and challenging the validity of some of the statements which had
been proclaimed by Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (a) Bahlool happened to be
present as well. Abu Hanifa proclaimed that he could not agree with the
three understated statements as made by the Imam.

The first one was that “Allah can never be seen.” According to Abu
Hanifa it was impossible for a thing to exist and yet be invisible!

The second things that the Imam had stated was that “Satan (devil) will
be thrown in the inferno of Hell which will scorch him bitterly.” Abu
Hanifa argued: “How was it possible for fire to hurt 'fire', the fact
that Satan was created from fire itself!”

The third statement of the Imam was that “Man alone is responsible for
his actions and Allah - the most powerful - has nothing to do with his
actions.” “How is it possible, when Allah alone guides the destiny of
man without Whose will nothing can happen?” This was Abu Hanifa's third
challenge.

As soon as the speaker, Abu Hanifa, had made these three criticisms,
Bahlool got up, took a piece of brick and aiming at Hanifa, let it go
and cracked Abu Hanifa head.

Bahlool was caught and taken before the Caliph for punishment. In his
defence, he pleaded that he had done nothing else except reply to the
three criticisms which Abu Hanifa had made against the Imam.

The Caliph asked him to explain as to how and why he chose to reply by
hitting and injuring Abu Hanifa. Bahlool said, “This man claims that if
God is there, then he must be seen. He is now complaining of pain in his
head due to the brick having hurt him. If the pain is definitely there,
can he show me where it is? Well! just as pain can be there without
being seen Allah also exists without being seen.”

“Secondly, he says that fire cannot burn fire. It is a fact that man is
made out of clay and this brick with which I hit his head is also made
out of clay, if clay can inflict pain and hurt clay, why can't fire do
the same to fire?”

“The third thing he says is that man is not responsible for his own
actions but Allah does all things. If this is so, then why does he want
justice from you and why does he want me to be punished for hurting him?
He might as well transfer the punishment to Allah Who, according to
him - is responsible for all the actions of man!”

Everyone in the court was stunned at this and Abu Hanifa was dumb
founded - having nothing to say. So Bahlool was released without any
punishment.

Thus, while some Muslim sects believe that Allah can be seen, perhaps on
the Day of Judgement, the Shia Muslims say that Allah is the creator of
everything; He was not created and as such he has no body like us that
can be seen. If we can still believe in unseen things like air,
electricity and human soul, why can't we believe in the unseen God?

If we are responsible for our actions and are to be punished or rewarded
accordingly, then it is only fair and just that Allan should not
manipulate or compel us to do things but leave us alone to act the way
we see it fit, and be answerable for those actions ourselves.
