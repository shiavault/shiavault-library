Chapter 4: Family Planning
==========================

Family Planning in Islam
------------------------

**Family Planning in Islam** [^1]

Family planning as a private measure to space or regulate the family
size for health or economic reasons is permissible in Islam. There is
neither any verse in the Qur\`an or ĥadīth against birth control, nor is
it obligatory to have children in marriage. Moreover, there are several
ahadith which categorically prove that birth control is permissible.

It is narrated from Imām °Alī : “One of the two (means) of affluence is
to have few dependents.”‘[^2]

It is narrated from Imām as-Ŝādiq (as) : “(Imām) °Ali ibn al-°usayn saw
no problem in coitus interruptus and he used to recite the verse that
‘When your Lord took from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their
descendants…’[^3] So from whatsoever (seed) Allāh (SwT) has taken a
covenant, it is sure to be born even if it is (spilled) on a hard
rock.”[^4]

According to the above tradition, creation is in the hand of Allāh (SwT)
alone. Whether or not we practice birth control, if Allāh (SwT) wills,
the child will be conceived.

In conclusion, the above aĥādith demonstrate that birth control is
permissible.

Methods of Contraception
------------------------

There are a number of different methods of contraception. The most
commonly used ones will be examined below to determine whether their use
is permissible in Islam or not. Permissibility has been determined by
the definition of the beginning of pregnancy according to the Islamic
point of view, which is when the fertilized ovum is implanted onto the
lining of the uterus. Therefore, whatever prevents implantation is
permissible and whatever terminates pregnancy after implantation is an
abortion and haraam.

It is necessary to note that these methods have been studied from the
fiqh point of view only. For the medical opinion about the reliability
or possible side-effects of these methods, please consult your doctor.

### Permissible Methods

The following methods do not involve surgical operation and are also
reversible. A man or woman using these methods can stop using them at
any time in order to conceive a child.

**1. Oral Contraceptives**

Birth control pills prevent conception by inhibiting ovulation. The
pills alter hormonal levels and suppress the hormonal signal from the
gland for the ovaries to release an ovum. These pills are taken orally
on a precise schedule for 20 or more days during each menstrual cycle.
Since all such pills inhibit ovulation, they are permissible; however,
the individual must consult the physician about possible side-effects.

There are some pills which work after the intercourse has taken place,
for example, the ‘morning-after pill’ or the recently developed RU486
pill. Again, since the use of such pills prevents implantation, it is
permissible. Therefore, the pills like the ‘morning-after’ and RU486 may
be taken after the intercourse BUT not after feeling or knowing that
pregnancy has already occurred.

**2. Depo-Provera**

Depo-Provera works exactly like the pills, but instead of taking it
orally it is injected once every three months. This and other similar
contraceptive methods by injection are also permissible.

**3. Intrauterie Devices (IUD)**

IUDs are plastic or metal objects, in a variety of shapes, which are
implanted inside the uterus. The medical experts do not exactly know how
IUD works. Presently there are two opinions: one says that IUD prevents
fertilization; and the other says that it prevents the fertilized ovum
from implantation onto the uterus. Since the pregnancy begins at
implantation according to the Islamic point of view, the use of IUD as a
birth control device is permissible, irrespective of the above
differences among the medical experts.

**4. Barrier Devices**

All barrier devices prevent the sperm from entering the uterus. This is
done by sheathing the penis with a condom, or by covering the cervix
with a diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge. The use of
spermicidal substances which kill the sperm before reaching the ovum is
also a barrier device. All of these are permissible forms of birth
control.

**5. Abstinence during fertile period**

There are three basic procedures to predict ovulation, in order to
avoide sexual intercourse during the approximately six days of a woman’s
most fertile monthly phase.

**These three methods are as follows**

a. Ovulation Method: A woman learns to recognize the fertile time by
checking the difference in the constitution of the cervical mucus
discharge. The cervical mucus discharge signals the highly fertile
period; and thus avoiding sex during this time prevents conception.

b. Rhythm Method: A method similar to the first, but it depends on
observing the monthly cycles for a whole year to determine the fertile
days.

c. Temperature: In this method, besides keeping a calendar record of her
cycle, a woman also takes her temperature daily to detect ovulation. She
can know her ovulation whenever her basal body temperature increases.

NOTE: Another more advanced option is to predict ovulation using an
ovulation test, which are designed to predict the most fertile days to
become pregnant.

**6. Withdrawal (Coitus Interruptus):**

Coitus interruptus means withdrawing the penis just before ejaculation.
This was the most common method of birth control before the invention of
modern devices.

It is narrated that Muĥammad bin Muslim and °Abdur Raĥmān bin Abi
°Abdillāh Maymun asked Imām as-Ŝādiq (as)  about withdrawal. The Imām
said: “It is up to the man; he may spill it wherever he wants.”[^5]

However, in another ĥadīth, Muĥammad bin Muslim narrated from fifth or
the sixth Imām as follows: “In case of a slave-girl, it is allowed,
however, in case of a free woman, I dislike it unless it had been so
stipulated at the time of marriage.”[^6]

Based on the above ahadith, the majority of our mujtahids believe that
coitus interruptus is allowed but Makrūh without the wife’s consent.[^7]

**7. Sterilization**

Sterilization involves surgical operation. Sterilization in men, known
as a vasectomy, involves the severing or blocking of the tube in the
male reproductive tract. This tube or duct passes sperm from the testes
to the prostate and other reproductive organs.

Sterilization in women, known as tubal ligation, involves the blocking
or severing of the fallopian tubes which transport the ovum.

Sterilization is not free from objection, although it is permissible if
it does not entail the prohibited methods outlined below.[^8]

### Prohibited Methods

Any method of birth control is prohibited under the following
circumstances:  
 a) When it poses serious harm to a woman’s health, such as removing
certain organs like the ovaries.  
 b) When it involves a ĥarām act, such as a male touching or looking at
the private parts of a woman that are forbidden for him to look at, is
prohibited.

These conditions can only be overridden in extreme circumstances, when
it is absolutely necessary.

Consent between husband and wife
--------------------------------

According to the legal aspect of Islamic law, the wife has full right to
the use of contraceptives, even without the consent and approval of her
husband.[^9] However, she should not use a method which may come in the
way of her husband’s conjugal rights. For example, she cannot force him
to use a condom or practice coitus interruptus.

This rule is based upon the principle that the extent of the husband’s
conjugal rights over his wife is just that she should be sexually
available, responsive, and cooperative. This right does not extend to
that of bearing children for him. Bearing children or not is a personal
decision of the woman, and therefore, she may use contraceptives such as
pills, injections or cleansing of the vagina after intercourse as they
do not interfere with her husband’s conjugal rights.

Conversely, the husband has no right to force his wife not to get
pregnant if she wants to, by forcing the use of pills, injections or the
use of an IUD. However, he is permitted to use a condom as long as he
has obtained her consent for that. Additionally, he does have the right
to do so by practising coitus interruptus during intercourse.

On a practical level however, such decisions are best made with mutual
consultation between the husband and the wife; otherwise, it could lead
to misunderstanding and mistrust. The legal aspect is to protect the
basic rights of women, but in the real world, man and woman must base
their life on love, mercy and cooperation as it is stated in Surat
al-Rūm (30), Verse 21:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَجَعَلَ بَيْنَكُمْ مَوَدَّةً وَرَحْمَةً 
  </p>
</blockquote>

***“And He ordained affection and mercy between you.”***

Abortion
--------

Islam’s approach to the issue of birth control and abortion is very
balanced. It allows women to prevent pregnancy but forbids them to
terminate it. Abortion after the implantation of the fertilized ovum in
the womb is absolutely forbidden and is considered a crime against the
law of God, as well as the foetus.

From the Islamic point of view, the illegitimacy of aborting a foetus
does not depend on the issue of whether the foetus has the status of a
human being or not. Although Islam does not recognize the foetus as a
human being, it still gives to it the right of a possible life.

Abortion is normally considered for various reasons. These will be
discussed, and the Islamic viewpoint of each reason considered:

**1. It is a choice between a child and a career and/or luxurious
life-style**

The above reason reflects the selfish nature of this materialistic
society, and is not considered a justifiable or acceptable reason for
abortion. Allāh (SwT) says:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَلاَ تَقْـتُلُوا أَوْلاَدَكُمْ مِّنْ إِمْلاَقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ
وَإِيَّاهُمْ 
  </p>
</blockquote>

“You shall not kill your children due to penury – We will provide for
you and for them.”[^10]

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 وَلاَ تَقْـتُلُوا أَوْلاَدَكُمْ خَشْيَةَ إِمْلاقٍ نَّحْنُ
نَرْزُقُهُمْ وَإِيَّاكُمْ إِنَّ قَتْلَهُمْ كَانَ خِطْءًا كَبِيرًا 
  </p>
</blockquote>

“Do not kill your children for the fear of penury: We will provide for
them and for you. Killing them is indeed a great iniquity.” [^11]  
 Indeed, has not Allāh (SwT) told us:

<blockquote dir="rtl">
  <p>
 لاَ نُكَلِّفُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا 
  </p>
</blockquote>

“We task no soul except according to its capacity.”[^12]

**2. A child is conceived illegitimately**

This is by-product of illicit sexual relations which Islam strongly
condemns, but is not considered an acceptable justification for aborting
the foetus.

**3. A child is an undesirable gender**

This reason is no less evil and cruel than the pre-Islamic °Arab custom
of burying baby girls alive, and is also not an acceptable justification
for an abortion.

**4. A child is a product of rape**

When a woman is raped, she should use the morning after pill or RU486
immediately after the sexual assault in order to prevent the possible
implantation of a fertilized ovum. However, once pregnancy is
established, then Islam does not allow abortion. In such cases, Islam
cannot justify the abortion of a child for the crime of the father. As
for the reputation of the woman, Islam strongly condemns the people who
look down upon the rape victim; instead of reviling her, they should be
sympathetic to her.

**5. A child has a defect**

With the use of ultrasounds and other such recent technology, it is
possible to know whether or not a child has a defect long before it is
born. Some people justify the abortion of a defective foetus.

However, the present mujtahids do not allow such abortions, even if the
deformities are so serious that they are untreatable after birth, and
the child may not survive after birth except for a short while and in
pain. The parents should pray and hope for a normal and healthy child.
Indeed, there are always chances that the foetus is developed contrary
medical prediction. This chance, however slim and negligible, denies us
the right to terminate a life.

**6. The pregnancy is dangerous to the woman**

The only permissible instance of abortion is if the foetus is less than
four months (before the soul enters into it) and doctors declare with
reasonable certainty that the continuation of pregnancy will harm her,
or cause her difficulty to a degree that is not normally tolerable.

It is not possible to abort the foetus after four months irrespective of
the reason for abortion.  
 Indemnity

If an abortion is carried out, whoever performs the abortion will become
liable for the payment of indemnity. This is regardless of whether or
not the abortion is done voluntarily, with the consent of one or both
parents.

The payment of indemnity forms part of the child’s estate and will go to
his heirs, i.e. his parents, even though they may have been party to the
decision. However, it is something that the parents, as his heirs, may
waive their rights to, hence removing the liability of payment from the
person who performs the abortion.

The payment is as follows[^13]:

**If the foetus is:**

Upto 40 days old – 70g of gold  
 Upto 80 days old – 140g of gold  
 Upto 120 days old – 210g of gold  
 Upto 160 days old – 280g of gold

**Older than that:**

If a male child is aborted – 3500g of gold  
 If a female child is aborted – 1750g of gold  
 In addition, one must do istighfar and pray for the forgiveness of
Allāh (SwT) so that the aborted life may not seek restitution.
