of his time.1

**BIRTH AND EARLY LIFE**

Sheikh As-Saduq was born in Qum. Although it was impossible to define
the very year in which he was born, it is well known that he was born
after the death of Mohammed bin Othman al-Omari (the second
representative),2 which was in the year 305 A.H. That was the opening
year of the representation of Abu al-Qasim al-Hussein bin Rawh (the
third representative), who died in 326 A.H.

As confirmation of this estimation, we provide the words of Sheikh
As-Saduq himself in his book titled Kamal ud-Din wa Tamam un-Ni'ma: Abu
Ja'far Mohammed bin Ali al-Aswad related to us: After the death of
Mohammed bin Othman al-Omari, Ali bin al-Hussein bin Musa bin Babawayh
(i.e. As-Saduq's father) asked me to tell Abu al-Qasim Ar-Rawhi -

2 After the Grand Invisibility ( Ghaybah ) of Imam al-Mahdi, God may
hasten his return, four representatives were successively appointed as
the means between the Imam and people. The second representative wa
Mohammed bin Othman al-Omari.

( 35 ) i.e. bin Rawh- to ask our master Sahib uz-Zaman1 to pray to
Allah for giving him a male baby. Abu al-Qasim informed that he asked
the Imam, who rejected. Three days later, Abu al-Qasim informed that the
Imam (a) had prayed to Allah for Ali bin al-Hussein and he would be
given a blessed male baby who would be the means by which Allah, Exalted
is He, would benefit (many people). Moreover, many boys would come after
that baby.

(Abu Ja'far Mohammed bin Ali al-Aswad said) After a period, Ali bin
al-Hussein was given Mohammed (i.e. As-Saduq) followed by many other
boys.2 (Another Narrative)

Sheikh At-Tusi said that some people narrated from Abu Ja'far Mohammed
bin Ali bin al-Hussein bin Musa bin Babawayh and Abu Abdullah al-Hussein
bin Ali bin Musa bin Babawayh (his brother) that Abu Ja'far Mohammed bin
Ali al-Aswad related to us: After the death of Mohammed bin Othman
al-Omari, Ali bin al-Hussein bin Musa bin Babawayh (i.e. As-Saduq's

1 Many are the titles of Imam al-Mahdi; God may hasten his return, such
like sahib uz-Zaman - the owner of the time -, al-Qadim - the
executor -, al-Muntazhar - the awaited -, and al-Hujja - the claim of
God -.

father) asked me to tell Abu al-Qasim Ar-Rawhi to ask our master Sahib
uz-Zaman (a) to pray to Allah for giving him a male baby. Abu al-Qasim
informed that he asked the Imam, who rejected. Three days later, Abu
al-Qasim informed that the Imam (a) had prayed to Allah for Ali bin
al-Hussein and he would be given a blessed male baby who would be the
means by which Allah, Exalted is He, would benefit (many people).
Moreover, many boys would come after that baby.

(Abu Ja'far Mohammed bin Ali al-Aswad said) I asked him to pray to
Allah to give me a male baby, but he did not answer. He said: This is
impossible. After a period, Ali bin al-Hussein was given Mohammed (i.e.
As-Saduq) followed by many other boys. For me, I was not given
anything.

Abu Ja'far bin Babawayh commented: As he noticed me attending the
classes of our master Mohammed bin al-Hussein bin al-Waleed frequently
while I was interested in recording and retaining the items of
knowledge, Abu Ja'far Mohammed bin Ali al-Aswad used to say to me, 'It
is not strange for you to have such an insistent desire for learning
since you came to this world by the supplication of the Imam, peace be
upon him.1

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Refer to al-Ghaybah; 23 H. 266.

Ar-Rawandi, in his al-Kharaa'ij, related the like of the previous
narrative, yet brief.1 Besides, At-Tabirsi, in his book titled A'lam
ul-Wara2, Sayyid Hashim al-Bahrani, in his Tabssirat ul-Wali3, and
Sayyid Ali bin Abdul-Karim An-Najafi, in his Muntakhab ul-Anwar
il-Mudhee'a4, referred to the same narrative.

Imaduddin Mohammed bin Ali At-Tusi, in his Thaqib ul-Manaqib,5 referred
to a part of that narrative.

In his reference to the biography of Ali bin al-Hussein bin Musa;
As-Saduq's father, An-Nejashi said that the man was in Iraq when he met
Abu al-Qasim al-Hussein bin Rawh (r) and asked him many questions. After
that, As-Saduq's father corresponded with Abu al-Qasim at the hands of
Ali bin Ja'far bin al-Aswad and asked him to deliver a paper to Imam
al-Mahdi, Allah may hasten his return, in which he asked for a male
baby. The answer was, 'We have prayed to Allah for you and you will be
given two virtuous male babies.'

Hence, Abu Ja'far and Abu Abdullah6, whose mother was a bondwoman, were
born.7

6 Abu Abdillah ( As-Saduq's brother ) is al-Hussein bin Ali bin
al-Hussein bin Musa bin Babawayh. He was also righteous master and
retainer. He dies in 418 A.H. He compiled many books, such as At-Tawhid
and Nafy ut-Tashbih.
7 Refer to Ar-Rijal; an-Nejashi 2661 H.684.

From the previous we can conclude that Sheikh As-Saduq (r) had come to
this world out of the prayer of Imam al-Hujja (a) after the death of
Mohammed bin Othman al-Omari; after the year 305 A.H., when his father
Sheikh Ali bin al-Hussein traveled to Iraq and met Abu al-Qasim
al-Hussein bin Rawh and asked him some questions… etc. Hence, Sheikh
As-Saduq was born in about 306 A.H.

Sheikh As-Saduq used to take pride in such a birth and say, 'I was born
due to the prayer of Imam al-Mahdi, peace be upon him.'1 Sheikh As-Saduq
grew up in the laps of virtue; his father used to feed him with the
knowledge, shower him with the abundance of his knowledge and
moralities, and circulate on him the lights of his purity, God-fearing,
piety, and ascetics. All these contributed in the scholastic perfection
and growth of Sheikh As-Saduq who lived under the wing of his father for
more than twenty years

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1 Refer to Ar-Rijal; an-Nejashi 2661 H.684.
during which he drank these knowledges and took from the great flow of
his father's information, moralities, and conducts. In addition, he grew
up in the city of Qum which was swarming with the scholars and
narrators, such as the master of the scholars of Qum Mohammed bin
al-Hasan bin Ahmed bin al-Waleed and Hamza bin Mohammed bin Ahmed bin
Ja'far bin Mohammed bin Zaid bin Ali as well as many others whose
sessions and lectures were frequently attended by Sheikh As-Saduq.

After a short while, Sheikh As-Saduq became that great figure by whom
people were benefiting. He also became such a distinctive sign of
retaining and intelligence. He exceeded his companions in fields of
virtue and knowledge and became such an unparalleled person.

Furthermore, the political circumstances of that period played a
significant role in crystallizing the personality of Sheikh As-Saduq who
lived in the reign of the Buyid in Iraq and Persia (321-447 A.H.), the
Fatimids in Northern Africa (296-567 A.H.), and the Hamdanian State in
Mousel -Northern Iraq- and Syria (333-394 A.H.)

It is well known that all these states were declaring their loyalty to
the leadership of the Prophet's household. In other words, they were
Shia.

**SCHOLASTIC JOURNEYS**

Not only was the intention of Sheikh As-Saduq to suffice with receiving
knowledge from the master scholars of his town, but also it rose higher
to encourage him to travel and emigrate far away from his hometown for
seeking studies and knowledge. In the beginning, he

traveled to the city of Ray to answer the summons of Rukn ad-Dawla
al-Buwayhi (the Buyid), who died in 366 A.H. There, Sheikh As-Saduq met
the scholars of that city, such like Sheikh Abu al-Hasan Mohammed bin
Ahmed bin Ali bin Asad al-Asadi whose famous nickname is Abu Jurada
al-Barda'i. That was in 347 A.H. He also met Ya'qoub bin Yousuf bin
Ya'qoub, Ahmed bin Mohammed bin As-Saqr As-Sa'igh al-Adl (the decent),
Abu Ali Ahmed bin al-Hasan al-Qattan and many others.

He then traveled to the city of Khurasan for the visitation of the Holy
Shrine of Imam Ar-Ridha (a) in 352 A.H. After that, he returned to the
city of Ray.

In 367 A.H., he made his second journey to the Holy Shrine of Imam
Ar-Ridha, peace be upon him. During his third journey which was made in
368 A.H., he passed by the cities of Istrabad1 and Jurjan2 where he
attended the lectures of Sheikh Abu al-Hasan Mohammed bin al-Qasim
Alistrabadi-the famous exegesist (of the Holy Quran) and orator. He also
attended the classes of Sheikh Abu Mohammed al-Qasim bin Mohammed
Alistrabadi, Sheikh Abu Mohammed Abdous bin Ali bin al-Abbas al-Jurjani,
and Sheikh Mohammed bin Ali Alistrabadi.

1 Istarabad is famous town of Tabaristan.

2 Jurjan is a famous city lying between Tabaristan and Khurasan.

In his journey back from the visitation of the Holy Shrine of Imam
Ar-Ridha (a) Sheikh As-Saduq passed by the city of Nisapur and resided
there for a period.

About this residence, he said:

"After I had satisfied my wishes for the visitation of Imam Ali bin
Musa Ar-Ridha (a) I was back in Nisapur where I resided. I found that
the majority of the Shia there, who were frequently referring to me,
were perplexed by the Invisibility -Ghaybah- and doubted the matter of
al-Qa'im, peace be upon him. They therefore left the right course of the
submission (to Allah) to join the path of personal opinions and analogy.
Hence, I exerted all my efforts for guiding them to the right and taking
them back to the path of correctitude by means of the relevant
narratives of the Prophet and the Imams, peace be upon them."1

In Nisapur, Sheikh As-Saduq related the lessons of most of the scholars
of that city, such like Sheikh Abu Ali al-Hussein bin Ahmed al-Bayhaqi,
Sheikh Abdul-Wahid bin Mohammed bin Abdous An-Nisapuri, Sheikh Abu
Mansour Ahmed bin Ibrahim bin Bakr al-Khuzi, Sheikh Abu Saeed Mohammed
bin al-Fadhl bin Mohammed bin Ishaq al-Muthekkir An-Nisapuri, Sheikh Abu
at-Tayyib al-Hussein bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Ar-Razi and many others.

As he passed by the cities of Marwalruth and Sarakhs1, Sheikh As-Saduq
attended the classes of Sheikh Mohammed bin Ali al-Marwalruthi, Sheikh
Abu Yousuf bin Abdullah bin Abdul-Malik, and Sheikh Abu Nasr Mohammed
bin Ahmed bin Tamim As-Sarakhsi.

In the years 352 and 355 A.H., Sheikh As-Saduq was in Baghdad where he
learnt from Sheikh Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Thabit Ad-Dawalibi, Sheikh Abu
Mohammed al-Hasan bin Mohammed bin Yahya al-Husseini al-Alawi; Ibn
Tahir, and Sheikh Ibrahim bin Harun al-Hiti as well as many others.

In 354 A.H., Sheikh As-Saduq had the honor to pilgrimage to the Holy
House of Allah. In his way, he passed by Kufa and learnt from the master
scholars there, such like Sheikh Mohammed bin Bakran An-Naqqash, Sheikh
Ahmed bin Ibrahim bin Harun al-Fami, Sheikh al-Hasan bin Mohammed bin
Saeed al-Hashimi, Sheikh Abu al-Hasan Ali bin Easa al-Mujawir, Sheikh
Abu Tharr Yahya bin Zaid bin al-Abbas bin al-Waleed al-Bezzaz, Sheikh
Abu al-Qasim al-Hasan bin Mohammed As-Sakuni al-Kufi and many others.

He also traveled to many cities such as Hamadan, Ilaq, Balkh,
Samarqand, Faraghana2 and others.

In such journeys, Sheikh as-Saduq attended the lessons of many scholars
in the cities that he passed by.

**SCHOLASTIC STATE AND THE SCHOLARS' OPINIONS**

Sheikh As-Saduq, Allah may promote his position, was one of the master
scholars of Shiism, great intellectuals, and well-versed men of
knowledge. He was such a grand mastermind, abundant knowledgeable, and
well informed. In his time, he was one of the most distinguishable
scholars to whom everyone referred in questions concerning the rulings
of the Sharia and was the sign upon whom everyone acted in the religious
problems. Sheikh At-Tusi; the master scholar of the sect mentioned
Sheikh As-Saduq with the following words:

Mohammed bin Ali bin al-Hussein bin Musa bin Babawayh al-Qummi is the
lofty master. His surname is Abu Ja'far. He was so admirable, good
narrator of hadith, skillful knowing of men, and bright criticizer of
narrations. Besides, he was such distinct relater and encyclopedic that
no one of the people of Qum could

attain his rank. He had written about three hundred books.1 An-Nejashi
referred to Sheikh As-Saduq with the following wording:

Abu Ja'far al-Qummi who resided in Ray was our Sheikh and master
jurisprudent. He was the representative of the sect (of Shiism) in
Khurasan.2 In his Me'aalim ul-Ulemaa, Ibn Shahrashoub said the following
about Sheikh As-Saduq:

He was the best of the scholars of Qum. He wrote about three hundred
books.3 In As-Saraa'ir, Ibn Idris referred to Sheikh As-Saduq with the
following wording:

He was trustworthy, highly reverent, well versed in narrations, good
criticizer of the reports, well knowing of men, and well memorizer. He
was the master of our Sheikh al-Mufid Mohammed bin Mohammed bin
An-Nu'man.4 Sheikh Hussein bin Abdus-Samad al-Harithi -father of Sheikh
al-Bahaa'i- said about Sheikh As-Saduq:

3 Refer to Me'aalim ul-Ulemaa; 111 H.764.
4 Refer to As-Saraa'ir; 2:529.

He was highly reverent, high-ranking scholar among the upper class as
well as the ordinary people, good narrator of hadith, well knowing of
jurisprudence and men, good discerning of the mental and analytical
sciences, and good criticizer of reports. He was also the master
scholar, jurisprudent, and chief of the Saved Sect (Shia) in Khurasan
and Iraq of the non-Arabs; (i.e. Persia).

In the fields of narration and abundance of knowledge, he was so
distinct over all those who lived in his time.1

The previous models have been few wordings of praise and extolment that
were said about Sheikh As-Saduq. To know more about this respectful
personality, it is recommendable to refer to the numerous reference
books that recorded the biography of him some of which we have just
excerpted.

**TEACHERS AND STUDENTS**

Because of the many journeys that Sheikh As-Saduq made to various
countries for the purpose of seeking studies, he could read, listen,
deliver lectures, and gain the license of many scholars and masters of
the countries that he passed by in the various fields of knowledge.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1 Refer to Ad-Diraya; 70.

A good look in his numerous books, such as al-Amali, Men La Yahdhuruh
ul-Faqih, At-Tawhid, Thawab ul-A'maal and many others, proves that he
rested upon many of the Shiite and Sunni master scholars in the field of
narrations. He also depended upon such scholars in the fields of hadith
regarding a great variety of sciences and fields. The famous names of
the master scholars upon whom Sheikh As-Saduq depended in relation of
the reports are innumerable.

For avoiding lengthiness, we ask the dear reader to refer to the
numerous books of biography so as to have an idea about the teachers of
Sheikh As-Saduq.

The students and the narrators on the authority of Sheikh As-Saduq are
also too many to be mentioned in this book. Reference books of biography

Mohammed bin An-Nu'man At-Tal'akbari whose nickname is Sheikh al-Mufid,
the trustworthy Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed bin al-Abbas (father of Sheikh
An-Nejashi), Sheikh Abu al-Hasan Mohammed bin Ahmed bin Ali bin Shathan
al-Qummi, Sayyid al-Murtedha Alam ul-Huda, and many others that we could
not mention their names in details. To have more information about such
names, it is recommendable to refer to the many books that discussed
this topic and from which we excerpted this brief biography.

**HIS DEATH**

Sheikh As-Saduq died in 381 A.H. He was more than seventy years old. He
was buried in the city of Ray near the tomb of Abdul-Azheem al-Hasani,
Allah be pleased with him.

Today, his tomb is one of the famous shrines whom are frequently
visited by people who seek blessings there. In nearly 1238 A. H., Sultan
Fat'h Ali Shah the Qajar reconstructed that holy shrine after the spread
of the news of the good charismata that had been seen there.

Al-Khawansari, in his Ar-Rawdhat, al-Mamuqani, in his Tanqeeh
ul-Maqaal, and other scholars mentioned a number of charismata of Sheikh
As-Saduq (after his death) occurred in his blessed shrine. In the year
1238 A.H., a fissure occurred to the shrine due to the heavy rain. When
some people entered inside the shrine for chasing the source of that
fissure, they could reach the gutter in which Sheikh As-Saduq was
buried. They found that his dead body was laid out while the genitals
were covered. It was very sound and handsome. On the nails of the body,
they could notice the signs of dye, while on the limbs, there were old
threads of the torn coffin.

As this event was rumored in the city of Tehran, Sultan Fat'h Ali…
ordered to reform that fissure and reconstruct that shrine.
