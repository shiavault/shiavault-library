Section Ix : of the Reason of Animals
=====================================

ALL our reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on a species
of Analogy, which leads us to expect from any cause the same events,
which we have observed to result from similar causes.

Where the causes are entirely similar, the analogy is perfect, and the
inference, drawn from it, is regarded as cer- tain and conclusive: nor
does any man ever entertain a doubt, where he sees a piece of iron, that
it will have weight and cohesion of parts; as in all other instances,
which have ever fallen under his observation.

But where the objects have not so exact a similarity, the analogy is
less perfect, and the inference is less conclusive; though still it has
some force, in proportion to the degree of similar- ity and resemblance.
The anatomical observations, formed upon one animal, are, by this
species of reasoning, extended to all animals; and it is certain, that
when the circulation of the blood, for instance, is clearly proved to
have place in one creature, as a frog, or fish, it forms a strong
presump- tion, that the same principle has place in all.

These ana- logical observations may be carried farther, even to this
science, of which we are now treating; and any theory, by which we
explain the operations of the understanding, or the origin and connexion
of the passions in man, will acquire additional authority, if we find,
that the same theory is requisite to explain the same phenomena in all
other animals.

We shall make trial of this, with regard to the hypothesis, by which we
have, in the foregoing discourse, endeavoured to account for all
experimental reasonings; and it is hoped, that this new point of view
will serve to confirm all our former observations. First, It seems
evident, that animals as well as men learn many things from experience,
and infer, that the same events will always follow from the same
causes.

By this principle they become acquainted with the more obvious
properties of external objects, and gradually, from their birth,
treasure up a knowledge of the nature of fire, water, earth, stones,
heights, depths, &c. , and of the effects which result from their
operation.

The ignorance and inexperience of the young are here plainly
distinguishable from the cunning and sagacity of the old, who have
learned, by long observation, to avoid what hurt them, and to pursue
what gave ease or pleasure. A horse, that has been accustomed to the
field, becomes acquainted with the proper height which he can leap, and
will never attempt what exceeds his force and ability.

An old greyhound will trust the more fatiguing part of the chace to the
younger, and will place himself so as to meet the hare in her doubles;
nor are the conjectures, which he forms on this occasion, founded in any
thing but his observation and experience. This is still more evident
from the effects of discipline and education on animals, who, by the
proper application of rewards and punishments, may be taught any course
of action, and most contrary to their natural instincts and
propensities.

Is it not experience, which renders a dog apprehensive of pain, when
you menace him, or lift up the whip to beat him? Is it not even
experience, which makes him answer to his name, and infer, from such an
arbitrary sound, that you mean him rather than any of his fellows, and
intend to call him, when you pronounce it in a certain manner, and with
a certain tone and accent?

In all these cases, we may observe, that the animal infers some fact
beyond what immediately strikes his senses; and that this inference is
altogether founded on past experience, while the creature expects from
the present object the same consequences, which it has always found in
its observation to result from similar objects. Secondly, It is
impossible, that this inference of the animal can be founded on any
process of argument or reasoning, by which he concludes, that like
events must follow like objects, and that the course of nature will
always be regular in its operations.

For if there be in reality any arguments of this nature, they surely
lie too abstruse for the observation of such imperfect understandings;
since it may well employ the utmost care and attention of a philosophic
genius to discover and observe them.

Animals, therefore are not guided in these inferences by reasoning:
neither are chil- dren; neither are the generality of mankind, in their
ordi- nary actions and conclusions: neither are philosophers them-
selves, who, in all the active parts of life, are, in the main, the same
with the vulgar, and are governed by the same maxims.

Nature must have provided some other principle, of more ready, and more
general use and applica- tion; nor can an operation of such immense
consequence in life, as that of inferring effects from causes, be
trusted to the uncertain process of reasoning and argumentation. Were
this doubtful with regard to men, it seems to admit of no question with
regard to the brute creation; and the conclusion being once firmly
established in the one, we have a strong presumption, from all the rules
of analogy, that it ought to be universally admitted, without any
exception or reserve.

It is custom alone, which engages animals, from every object, that
strikes their senses, to infer its usual attendant, and carries their
imagination, from the appearance of the one, to conceive the other, in
that partic- ular manner, which we denominate belief. No other ex-
plication can be given of this operation, in all the higher, as well as
lower classes of sensitive beings, which fall under our notice and
observation.

[^1] But though animals learn many parts of their knowledge from
observation, there are also many parts of it, which they derive from the
original hand of nature; which much exceed the share of capacity they
possess on ordinary occa- sions; and in which they improve, little or
nothing, by the longest practice and experience.

These we denominate Instincts, and are so apt to admire as something
very extraor- dinary, and inexplicable by all the disquisitions of human
understanding.

But our wonder will, perhaps, cease or diminish, when we consider, that
the experimental reason- ing itself, which we possess in common with
beasts, and on which the whole conduct of life depends, is nothing but a
species of instinct or mechanical power, that acts in us unknown to
ourselves; and in its chief operations, is not directed by any such
relations or comparisons of ideas, as are the proper objects of our
intellectual faculties. Though the instinct be different, yet still it
is an instinct, which teaches a man to avoid the fire; as much as that,
which teaches a bird, with such exactness, the art of incubation, and
the whole economy and order of its nursery.

[^1] Since all reasoning concerning facts or causes is derived merely
from custom, it may be asked how it happens, that men so much surpass
animals in reasoning, and one man so much surpasses another? Has not the
same custom the same influence on all? We shall here endeavour briefly
to explain the great difference in human understandings: After which the
reason of the difference between men and animals will easily be
comprehended. 1.

When we have lived any time, and have been accustomed to the uni-
formity of nature, we acquire a general habit, by which we always
transfer the known to the unknown, and conceive the latter to resemble
the former.

By means of this general habitual principle, we regard even one experi-
ment as the foundation of reasoning, and expect a similar event with
some degree of certainty, where the experiment has been made accurately,
and free from all foreign circumstances. It is therefore considered as a
matter of great importance to observe the consequences of things; and as
one man may very much surpass another in attention and memory and
observation, this will make a very great difference in their
reasoning.

2. Where there is a complication of causes to produce any effect, one
mind may be much larger than another, and better able to comprehend the
whole system of objects, and to infer justly their consequences.

3. One man is able to carry on a chain of consequences to a greater
length than another.

4. Few men can think long without running into a confusion of ideas,
and mistaking one for another; and there are various degrees of this
infirmity.

5. The circumstance, on which the effect depends, is frequently
involved in other circumstances, which are foreign and extrinsic. The
separation of it often requires great attention, accuracy, and
subtility.

6. The forming of general maxims from particular observation is a very
nice operation; and nothing is more usual, from haste or a narrowness of
mind, which sees not on all sides, than to commit mistakes in this
particular.

7. When we reason from analogies, the man, who has the greater experi-
ence or the greater promptitude of suggesting analogies, will be the
better reasoner.

8. Biases from prejudice, education, passion, party, &c. hang more upon
one mind than another.

9. After we have acquired a confidence in human testimony, books and
conversation enlarge much more the sphere of one man's experience and
thought than those of another.

It would be easy to discover many other circumstances that make a
difference in the understandings of men.
