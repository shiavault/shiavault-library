Section Iv : Sceptical Doubts Concerning the Operations of the Understanding
============================================================================

PART I ALL the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be
divided into two kinds, to wit, Rela- tions of Ideas, and Matters of
Fact. Of the first kind are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and
Arithmetic; and in short, every affirmation which is either intuitively
or demonstratively certain.

That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the square of the two
sides, is a proposition which expresses a relation between these
figures. That three times five is equal to the half of thirty, expresses
a relation between these numbers.

Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of
thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the
universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the
truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their certainty and
evidence. Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason,
are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their
truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing.

The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible; because it can
never imply a contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same
facility and dis- tinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality.

That the sun will not rise to-morrow is no less intelligible a propo-
sition, and implies no more contradiction than the affirma- tion, that
it will rise. We should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its
falsehood.

Were it demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and
could never be dis- tinctly conceived by the mind. It may, therefore, be
a subject worthy of curiosity, to enquire what is the nature of that
evidence which assures us of any real existence and matter of fact,
beyond the present testimony of our senses, or the records of our
memory.

This part of philosophy, it is observable, has been little cultivated,
either by the ancients or moderns; and therefore our doubts and errors,
in the prosecution of so important an enquiry, may be the more
excusable; while we march through such difficult paths without any guide
or direction.

They may even prove useful, by exciting curiosity, and destroying that
implicit faith and security, which is the bane of all reasoning and free
enquiry. The discovery of defects in the common philosophy, if any such
there be, will not, I presume, be a discouragement, but rather an
incitement, as is usual, to attempt something more full and satisfactory
than has yet been proposed to the public.

All reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to be founded on the
relation of Cause and Effect. By means of that relation alone we can go
beyond the evidence of our memory and senses.

If you were to ask a man, why he believes any matter of fact, which is
absent; for instance, that his friend is in the country, or in France;
he would give you a reason; and this reason would be some other fact; as
a letter received from him, or the knowledge of his former resolutions
and promises.

A man finding a watch or any other machine in a desert island, would
conclude that there had once been men in that island. All our rea-
sonings concerning fact are of the same nature.

And here it is constantly supposed that there is a connexion between
the present fact and that which is inferred from it. Were there nothing
to bind them together, the inference would be entirely precarious.

The hearing of an articulate voice and rational discourse in the dark
assures us of the pres- ence of some person: Why? because these are the
effects of the human make and fabric, and closely connected with it. If
we anatomize all the other reasonings of this nature, we shall find that
they are founded on the relation of cause and effect, and that this
relation is either near or remote, direct or collateral.

Heat and light are collateral effects of fire, and the one effect may
justly be inferred from the other. If we would satisfy ourselves,
therefore, concerning the nature of that evidence, which assures us of
matters of fact, we must enquire how we arrive at the knowledge of cause
and effect.

I shall venture to affirm, as a general proposition, which admits of no
exception, that the knowledge of this relation is not, in any instance,
attained by reasonings a priori; but arises entirely from experience,
when we find that any particular objects are constantly conjoined with
each other.

Let an object be presented to a man of ever so strong natural reason
and abilities; if that object be entirely new to him, he will not be
able, by the most accurate examination of its sensible qualities, to
discover any of its causes or effects.

Adam, though his rational faculties be supposed, at the very first,
entirely perfect, could not have inferred from the fluidity and
transparency of water that it would suffo- cate him, or from the light
and warmth of fire that it would consume him.

No object ever discovers, by the qualities which appear to the senses,
either the causes which pro- duced it, or the effects which will arise
from it; nor can our reason, unassisted by experience, ever draw any in-
ference concerning real existence and matter of fact.

This proposition, that causes and effects are discoverable, not by
reason but by experience, will readily be admitted with regard to such
objects, as we remember to have once been altogether unknown to us;
since we must be conscious of the utter inability, which we then lay
under, of foretelling what would arise from them.

Present two smooth pieces of marble to a man who has no tincture of
natural philosophy; he will never discover that they will adhere
together in such a manner as to require great force to separate them in
a direct line, while they make so small a resistance to a lateral
pressure.

Such events, as bear little analogy to the common course of nature, are
also readily confessed to be known only by experience; nor does any man
imagine that the explosion of gunpowder, or the attraction of a load-
stone, could ever be discovered by arguments a priori.

In like manner, when an effect is supposed to depend upon an intricate
machinery or secret structure of parts, we make no difficulty in
attributing all our knowledge of it to experience.

Who will assert that he can give the ultimate reason, why milk or bread
is proper nourishment for a man, not for a lion or a tiger? But the same
truth may not appear, at first sight, to have the same evidence with
regard to events, which have become familiar to us from our first
appearance in the world, which bear a close analogy to the whole course
of nature, and which are supposed to depend on the simple qualities of
objects, without any secret structure of parts.

We are apt to imagine that we could discover these effects by the mere
operation of our reason, without experience. We fancy, that were we
brought on a sudden into this world, we could at first have inferred
that one Billiard-ball would communicate motion to another upon impulse;
and that we needed not to have waited for the event, in order to pro-
nounce with certainty concerning it.

Such is the influence of custom, that, where it is strongest, it not
only covers our natural ignorance, but even conceals itself, and seems
not to take place, merely because it is found in the highest degree. But
to convince us that all the laws of nature, and all the operations of
bodies without exception, are known only by experience, the following
reflections may, perhaps, suf- fice.

Were any object presented to us, and were we required to pronounce
concerning the effect, which will result from it, without consulting
past observation; after what manner, I beseech you, must the mind
proceed in this operation? It must invent or imagine some event, which
it ascribes to the object as its effect; and it is plain that this
invention must be entirely arbitrary.

The mind can never possibly find the effect in the supposed cause, by
the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the effect is totally
different from the cause, and consequently can never be discovered in
it.

Motion in the second Billiard-ball is a quite distinct event from
motion in the first; nor is there anything in the one to suggest the
smallest hint of the other.

A stone or piece of metal raised into the air, and left without any
support, immediately falls: but to consider the matter a priori, is
there anything we discover in this situation which can beget the idea of
a downward, rather than an upward, or any other motion, in the stone or
metal? And as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect,
in all natural operations, is arbitrary, where we con- sult not
experience; so must we also esteem the supposed tie or connexion between
the cause and effect, which binds them together, and renders it
impossible that any other effect could result from the operation of that
cause.

When I see, for instance, a Billiard-ball moving in a straight line
towards another; even suppose motion in the second ball should by
accident be suggested to me, as the result of their contact or impulse;
may I not conceive, that a hundred dif- ferent events might as well
follow from that cause? May not both these balls remain at absolute
rest? May not the first ball return in a straight line, or leap off from
the second in any line or direction? All these suppositions are con-
sistent and conceivable.

Why then should we give the preference to one, which is no more
consistent or conceivable than the rest? All our reasonings a priori
will never be able to show us any foundation for this preference.

In a word, then, every effect is a distinct event from its cause.

It could not, therefore, be discovered in the cause, and the first
invention or conception of it, a priori, must be entirely arbitrary. And
even after it is suggested, the con- junction of it with the cause must
appear equally arbitrary; since there are always many other effects,
which, to reason, must seem fully as consistent and natural.

In vain, there- fore, should we pretend to determine any single event,
or infer any cause or effect, without the assistance of observa- tion
and experience.

Hence we may discover the reason why no philosopher, who is rational
and modest, has ever pretended to assign the ultimate cause of any
natural operation, or to show distinctly the action of that power, which
produces any single effect in the universe. It is confessed, that the
utmost effort of human reason is to reduce the principles, productive of
natural phenomena, to a greater simplicity, and to resolve the many
particular effects into a few gen- eral causes, by means of reasonings
from analogy, experi- ence, and observation. But as to the causes of
these general causes, we should in vain attempt their discovery; nor
shall we ever be able to satisfy ourselves, by any particular ex-
plication of them.

These ultimate springs and principles are totally shut up from human
curiosity and enquiry.

Elas- ticity, gravity, cohesion of parts, communication of motion by
impulse; these are probably the ultimate causes and prin- ciples which
we shall ever discover in nature; and we may esteem ourselves
sufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry and reasoning, we can trace
up the particular phenomena to, or near to, these general principles.

The most perfect philosophy of the natural kind only staves off our
ignorance a little longer: as perhaps the most perfect philosophy of the
moral or metaphysical kind serves only to discover larger portions of
it. Thus the observation of human blindness and weakness is the result
of all philosophy, and meets us at every turn, in spite of our
endeavours to elude or avoid it.

Nor is geometry, when taken into the assistance of natural philosophy,
ever able to remedy this defect, or lead us into the knowledge of
ultimate causes, by all that accuracy of reasoning for which it is so
justly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics proceeds upon the
supposition that certain laws are established by nature in her
operations; and abstract reasonings are employed, either to assist ex-
perience in the discovery of these laws, or to determine their influence
in particular instances, where it depends upon any precise degree of
distance and quantity.

Thus, it is a law of motion, discovered by experience, that the mo-
ment or force of any body in motion is in the compound ratio or
proportion of its solid contents and its velocity; and consequently,
that a small force may remove the greatest obstacle or raise the
greatest weight, if, by any contrivance or machinery, we can increase
the velocity of that force, so as to make it an overmatch for its
antagonist.

Geometry assists us in the application of this law, by giving us the
just dimensions of all the parts and figures which can enter into any
species of machine; but still the discovery of the law itself is owing
merely to experience, and all the abstract reasonings in the world could
never lead us one step towards the knowledge of it.

When we reason a priori, and consider merely any object or cause, as it
appears to the mind, inde- pendent of all observation, it never could
suggest to us the notion of any distinct object, such as its effect;
much less, show us the inseparable and inviolable connexion between
them. A man must be very sagacious who could discover by reasoning that
crystal is the effect of heat, and ice of cold, without being previously
acquainted with the operation of these qualities.

PART II BUT we have not yet attained any tolerable satisfac- tion with
regard to the question first proposed.

Each solution still gives rise to a new question as difficult as the
foregoing, and leads us on to farther enquiries. When it is asked, What
is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact? the
proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of
cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all
our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be
replied in one word, Experience.

But if we still carry on our sifting humour, and ask, What is the
foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new
question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication.

Philosophers, that give themselves airs of superior wisdom and
sufficiency, have a hard task when they encounter per- sons of
inquisitive dispositions, who push them from every corner to which they
retreat, and who are sure at last to bring them to some dangerous
dilemma. The best expedient to prevent this confusion, is to be modest
in our preten- sions; and even to discover the difficulty ourselves
before it is objected to us.

By this means, we may make a kind of merit of our very ignorance.

I shall content myself, in this section, with an easy task, and shall
pretend only to give a negative answer to the question here proposed. I
say then, that, even after we have experience of the operations of cause
and effect, our conclusions from that experience are not founded on
reason- ing, or any process of the understanding. This answer we must
endeavour both to explain and to defend.

It must certainly be allowed, that nature has kept us at a great
distance from all her secrets, and has afforded us only the knowledge of
a few superficial qualities of ob- jects; while she conceals from us
those powers and prin- ciples on which the influence of those objects
entirely de- pends.

Our senses inform us of the colour, weight, and consistence of bread;
but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those qualities which
fit it for the nourish- ment and support of a human body. Sight or
feeling con- veys an idea of the actual motion of bodies; but as to that
wonderful force or power, which would carry on a moving body for ever in
a continued change of place, and which bodies never lose but by
communicating it to others; of this we cannot form the most distant
conception.

But not- withstanding this ignorance of natural powers[^1] and princi-
ples, we always presume, when we see like sensible quali- ties, that
they have like secret powers, and expect that effects, similar to those
which we have experienced, will follow from them. If a body of like
colour and consistence with that bread, which we have formerly eat, be
pre- sented to us, we make no scruple of repeating the experi- ment, and
foresee, with certainty, like nourishment and support.

Now this is a process of the mind or thought, of which I would
willingly know the foundation. It is allowed on all hands that there is
no known connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret powers;
and consequently, that the mind is not led to form such a con- clusion
concerning their constant and regular conjunction, by anything which it
knows of their nature.

As to past Experience, it can be allowed to give direct and certain
information of those precise objects only, and that precise period of
time, which fell under its cognizance: but why this experience should be
extended to future times, and to other objects, which for aught we know,
may be only in appearance similar; this is the main question on which I
would insist.

The bread, which I formerly eat, nourished me; that is, a body of such
sensible qualities was, at that time, endued with such secret powers:
but does it follow, that other bread must also nourish me at another
time, and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like
secret powers? The consequence seems nowise neces- sary.

At least, it must be acknowledged that there is here a consequence
drawn by the mind; that there is a certain step taken; a process of
thought, and an inference, which wants to be explained. These two
propositions are far from being the same. I have found that such an
object has always been attended with such an effect, and I foresee, that
other objects, which are, in appearance, similar, will be attended with
similar effects.

I shall allow, if you please, that the one proposition may justly be
inferred from the other: I know, in fact, that it always is inferred.
But if you insist that the inference is made by a chain of reasoning, I
desire you to produce that reasoning. The connexion between these
propositions is not intuitive.

There is re- quired a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an
inference, if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argu- ment. What that
medium is, I must confess, passes my comprehension; and it is incumbent
on those to produce it, who assert that it really exists, and is the
origin of all our conclusions concerning matter of fact.

This negative argument must certainly, in process of time, become
altogether convincing, if many penetrating and able philosophers shall
turn their enquiries this way and no one be ever able to discover any
connecting propo- sition or intermediate step, which supports the
understand- ing in this conclusion.

But as the question is yet new, every reader may not trust so far to
his own penetration, as to conclude, because an argument escapes his
enquiry, that therefore it does not really exist. For this reason it may
be requisite to venture upon a more difficult task; and enumerating all
the branches of human knowledge, en- deavour to show that none of them
can afford such an argument.

All reasonings may be divided into two kinds, namely, demonstrative
reasoning, or that concerning relations of ideas, and moral reasoning,
or that concerning matter of fact and existence.

That there are no demonstrative argu- ments in the case seems evident;
since it implies no con- tradiction that the course of nature may
change, and that an object, seemingly like those which we have experi-
enced, may be attended with different or contrary effects.

May I not clearly and distinctly conceive that a body, falling from the
clouds, and which, in all other respects, resembles snow, has yet the
taste of salt or feeling of fire? Is there any more intelligible
proposition than to affirm, that all the trees will flourish in December
and January, and decay in May and June? Now whatever is intelligible,
and can be distinctly conceived, implies no contradiction, and can never
be proved false by any demon- strative argument or abstract reasoning a
priori.

If we be, therefore, engaged by arguments to put trust in past
experience, and make it the standard of our future judgment, these
arguments must be probable only, or such as regard matter of fact and
real existence according to the division above mentioned.

But that there is no argument of this kind, must appear, if our
explication of that species of reasoning be admitted as solid and
satisfactory. We have said that all arguments concerning existence are
founded on the relation of cause and effect; that our knowledge of that
relation is derived entirely from experi- ence; and that all our
experimental conclusions proceed upon the supposition that the future
will be conformable to the past. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of
this last supposition by probable arguments, or arguments regarding
existence, must be evidently going in a circle, and taking that for
granted, which is the very point in question.

In reality, all arguments from experience are founded on the similarity
which we discover among natural objects, and by which we are induced to
expect effects similar to those which we have found to follow from such
objects.

And though none but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the
authority of experience, or to reject that great guide of human life, it
may surely be allowed a philoso- pher to have so much curiosity at least
as to examine the principle of human nature, which gives this mighty
authority to experience, and makes us draw advantage from that
similarity which nature has placed among different objects. \>From
causes which appear similar we expect similar effects.

This is the sum of all our experimental conclusions. Now it seems
evident that, if this conclusion were formed by reason, it would be as
perfect at first, and upon one in- stance, as after ever so long a
course of experience.

But the case is far otherwise. Nothing so like as eggs; yet no one, on
account of this appearing similarity, expects the same taste and relish
in all of them. It is only after a long course of uniform experiments in
any kind, that we attain a firm reliance and security with regard to a
particular event. Now where is that process of reasoning which, from one
instance, draws a conclusion, so different from that which it infers
from a hundred instances that are nowise different from that single one?
This question I propose as much for the sake of information, as with an
intention of raising difficulties.

I cannot find, I cannot imagine any such reasoning. But I keep my mind
still open to instruction, if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it on
me.

Should it be said that, from a number of uniform experi- ments, we
infer a connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret powers;
this, I must confess, seems the same difficulty, couched in different
terms.

The question still recurs, on what process of argument this inference
is founded? Where is the medium, the interposing ideas, which join
propositions so very wide of each other? It is confessed that the
colour, consistence, and other sensible qualities of bread appear not,
of themselves, to have any connexion with the secret powers of
nourishment and sup- port.

For otherwise we could infer these secret powers from the first
appearance of these sensible qualities, without the aid of experience;
contrary to the sentiment of all philosophers, and contrary to plain
matter of fact.

Here, then, is our natural state of ignorance with regard to the powers
and influence of all objects. How is this remedied by experience? It
only shows us a number of uniform effects, resulting from certain
objects, and teaches us that those particular objects, at that
particular time, were en- dowed with such powers and forces.

When a new object, endowed with similar sensible qualities, is
produced, we expect similar powers and forces, and look for a like
effect. \>From a body of like colour and consistence with bread we
expect like nourishment and support. But this surely is a step or
progress of the mind, which wants to be explained.

When a man says, I have found, in all past instances, such sensible
qualities conjoined with such secret powers: And when he says, Similar
sensible qualities will always be con- joined with similar secret
powers, he is not guilty of a tau- tology, nor are these propositions in
any respect the same. You say that the one proposition is an inference
from the other.

But you must confess that the inference is not intuitive; neither is it
demonstrative: Of what nature is it, then? To say it is experimental, is
begging the question. For all inferences from experience suppose, as
their founda- tion, that the future will resemble the past, and that
similar powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qualities.

If there be any suspicion that the course of nature may change, and
that the past may be no rule for the future, all experience becomes
useless, and can give rise to no in- ference or conclusion.

It is impossible, therefore, that any arguments from experience can
prove this resemblance of the past to the future; since all these
arguments are founded on the supposition of that resemblance. Let the
course of things be allowed hitherto ever so regular; that alone,
without some new argument or inference, proves not that, for the future,
it will continue so.

In vain do you pretend to have learned the nature of bodies from your
past experience. Their secret nature, and consequently all their effects
and influence, may change, without any change in their sensible
qualities. This happens some- times, and with regard to some objects:
Why may it not happen always, and with regard to all objects? What
logic, what process or argument secures you against this supposi- tion?
My practice, you say, refutes my doubts. But you mistake the purport of
my question.

As an agent, I am quite satisfied in the point; but as a philosopher,
who has some share of curiosity, I will not say scepticism, I want to
learn the foundation of this inference. No reading, no enquiry has yet
been able to remove my difficulty, or give me satisfaction in a matter
of such importance. Can I do better than propose the difficulty to the
public, even though, perhaps, I have small hopes of obtaining a
solution? We shall at least, by this means, be sensible of our
ignorance, if we do not augment our knowledge.

I must confess that a man is guilty of unpardonable arrogance who
concludes, because an argument has es- caped his own investigation, that
therefore it does not really exist.

I must also confess that, though all the learned, for several ages,
should have employed themselves in fruit- less search upon any subject,
it may still, perhaps, be rash to conclude positively that the subject
must, therefore, pass all human comprehension. Even though we examine
all the sources of our knowledge, and conclude them un- fit for such a
subject, there may still remain a suspicion, that the enumeration is not
complete, or the examination not accurate.

But with regard to the present subject, there are some considerations
which seem to remove all this accusation of arrogance or suspicion of
mistake. It is certain that the most ignorant and stupid peasants-- nay
infants, nay even brute beasts--improve by experience, and learn the
qualities of natural objects, by observing the effects which result from
them. When a child has felt the sensation of pain from touching the
flame of a candle, he will be careful not to put his hand near any
candle; but will expect a similar effect from a cause which is similar
in its sensible qualities and appearance.

If you assert, there- fore, that the understanding of the child is led
into this conclusion by any process of argument or ratiocination, I may
justly require you to produce that argument; nor have you any pretence
to refuse so equitable a demand.

You cannot say that the argument is abstruse, and may possibly escape
your enquiry; since you confess that it is obvious to the capacity of a
mere infant.

If you hesitate, therefore, a moment, or if, after reflection, you
produce any intricate or profound argument, you, in a manner, give up
the question, and confess that it is not reasoning which engages us to
suppose the past resembling the future, and to expect similar effects
from causes which are, to appear- ance, similar.

This is the proposition which I intended to enforce in the present
section.

If I be right, I pretend not to have made any mighty discovery.

And if I be wrong, I must acknowledge myself to be indeed a very
backward scholar; since I cannot now discover an argument which, it
seems, was perfectly familiar to me long before I was out of my cradle.
[^1] The word, Power, is here used in a loose and popular sense.

The more accurate explication of it would give additional evidence to
this argument. See Sect.
