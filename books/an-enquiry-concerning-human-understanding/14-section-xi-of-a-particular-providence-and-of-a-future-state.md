Section Xi : of a Particular Providence and of a Future State
=============================================================

I WAS lately engaged in conversation with a friend who loves sceptical
paradoxes; where, though he ad- vanced many principles, of which I can
by no means approve, yet as they seem to be curious, and to bear some
relation to the chain of reasoning carried on throughout this enquiry, I
shall here copy them from my memory as accurately as I can, in order to
submit them to the judge- ment of the reader.

Our conversation began with my admiring the singular good fortune of
philosophy, which, as it requires entire liberty above all other
privileges, and chiefly flourishes from the free opposition of
sentiments and argumentation, received its first birth in an age and
country of freedom and toleration, and was never cramped, even in its
most extrav- agant principles, by any creeds, concessions, or penal
statutes.

For, except the banishment of Protagoras, and the death of Socrates,
which last event proceeded partly from other motives, there are scarcely
any instances to be met with, in ancient history, of this bigoted
jealousy, with which the present age is so much infested.

Epicurus lived at Athens to an advanced age, in peace and tranquillity:
Epicureans[^1] were even admitted to receive the sacerdotal character,
and to officiate at the altar, in the most sacred rites of the
established religion: and the public encourage- ment[^2] of pensions and
salaries was afforded equally, by the wisest of all the Roman
emperors[^3], to the professors of every sect of philosophy.

How requisite such kind of treat- ment was to philosophy, in her early
youth, will easily be conceived, if we reflect, that, even at present,
when she may be supposed more hardy and robust, she bears with much
difficulty the inclemency of the seasons, and those harsh winds of
calumny and persecution, which blow upon her.

You admire, says my friend, as the singular good fortune of philosophy,
what seems to result from the natural course of things, and to be
unavoidable in every age and nation.

This pertinacious bigotry, of which you complain, as so fatal to
philosophy, is really her offspring, who, after allying with
superstition, separates himself entirely from the interest of his
parent, and becomes her most inveterate enemy and persecutor.

Speculative dogmas of religion, the present occasions of such furious
dispute, could not possibly be con- ceived or admitted in the early ages
of the world; when mankind, being wholly illiterate, formed an idea of
religion more suitable to their weak apprehension, and composed their
sacred tenets of such tales chiefly as were the objects of traditional
belief, more than of argument or disputation.

After the first alarm, therefore, was over, which arose from the new
paradoxes and principles of the philosophers; these teachers seem ever
after, during the ages of antiquity, to have lived in great harmony with
the established supersti- tion, and to have made a fair partition of
mankind between them; the former claiming all the learned and wise, the
latter possessing all the vulgar and illiterate.

It seems then, say I, that you leave politics entirely out of the
question, and never suppose, that a wise magistrate can justly be
jealous of certain tenets of philosophy, such as those of Epicurus,
which, denying a divine existence, and conse- quently a providence and a
future state, seem to loosen, in a great measure the ties of morality,
and may be supposed, for that reason, pernicious to the peace of civil
society.

I know, replied he, that in fact these persecutions never, in any age,
proceeded from calm reason, or from experience of the pernicious
consequences of philosophy; but arose entirely from passion and
prejudice.

But what if I should advance farther, and assert, that if Epicurus had
been ac- cused before the people, by any of the sycophants or inform-
ers of those days, he could easily have defended his cause, and proved
his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his
adversaries, who endeavoured, with such zeal, to expose him to the
public hatred and jealousy?

I wish, said I, you would try your eloquence upon so extraordinary a
topic, and make a speech for Epicurus, which might satisfy, not the mob
of Athens, if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have
contained any mob, but the more philosophical part of his audience, such
as might be supposed capable of comprehending his arguments.

The matter would not be difficult, upon such conditions, replied he:
and if you please, I shall suppose myself Epi- curus for a moment, and
make you stand for the Athenian people, and shall deliver you such an
harangue as will fill all the urn with white beans, and leave not a
black one to gratify the malice of my adversaries.

Very well: pray proceed upon these suppositions.

I come hither, O ye Athenians, to justify in your assembly what I
maintain in my school, and I find myself impeached by furious
antagonists, instead of reasoning with calm and dispassionate enquirers.
Your deliberations, which of right should be directed to questions of
public good, and the interest of the commonwealth, are diverted to the
disquisi- tions of speculative philosophy; and these magnificent, but
perhaps fruitless enquiries, take place of your more familiar but more
useful occupations.

But so far as in me lies, I will prevent this abuse.

We shall not here dispute con- cerning the origin and government of
worlds.

We shall only enquire how far such questions concern the public
interest.

And if I can persuade you, that they are entirely indifferent to the
peace of society and security of government, I hope that you will
presently send us back to our schools, there to examine, at leisure, the
question the most sublime, but, at the same time, the most speculative
of all philosophy.

The religious philosophers, not satisfied with the tradition of your
forefathers, and doctrine of your priests (in which I willingly
acquiesce), indulge a rash curiosity, in trying how far they can
establish religion upon the principles of reason; and they thereby
excite, instead of satisfying, the doubts, which naturally arise from a
diligent and scrutinous enquiry.

They paint, in the most magnificent colours, the order, beauty, and
wise arrangement of the universe; and then ask, if such a glorious
display of intelligence could proceed from the fortuitous concourse of
atoms, or if chance could produce what the greatest genius can never
sufficiently admire.


I shall not examine the justness of this argument.

I shall allow it to be as solid as my antagonists and accusers can
desire.

It is sufficient, if I can prove, from this very reasoning, that the
question is entirely speculative, and that, when, in my philosophical
disquisitions, I deny a providence and a future state, I undermine not
the founda- tions of society, but advance principles, which they them-
selves, upon their own topics, if they argue consistently, must allow to
be solid and satisfactory.

You then, who are my accusers, have acknowledged, that the chief or
sole argument for a divine existence (which I never questioned) is
derived from the order of nature; where there appear such marks of
intelligence and design, that you think it extravagant to assign for its
cause, either chance, or the blind and unguided force of matter.

You allow, that this is an argument drawn from effects to
causes. \>From the order of the work, you infer, that there must have
been project and forethought in the workman. If you can- not make out
this point, you allow, that your conclusion fails; and you pretend not
to establish the conclusion in a greater latitude than the phenomena of
nature will justify.

These are your concessions.

I desire you to mark the con- sequences.

When we infer any particular cause from an effect, we must proportion
the one to the other, and can never be allowed to ascribe to the cause
any qualities, but what are exactly sufficient to produce the effect. A
body of ten ounces raised in any scale may serve as a proof, that the
counterbalancing weight exceeds ten ounces; but can never afford a
reason that it exceeds a hundred.

If the cause, assigned for any effect, be not sufficient to produce it,
we must either reject that cause, or add to it such qualities as will
give it a just proportion to the effect.

But if we ascribe to it farther qualities, or affirm it capable of
producing other effects, we can only indulge the licence of conjecture,
and arbitrarily suppose the existence of qualities and energies, without
reason or authority. The same rule holds, whether the cause assigned be
brute unconscious matter, or a rational intelligent being.

If the cause be known only by the effect, we never ought to ascribe to
it any qualities, beyond what are precisely requisite to produce the
effect: nor can we, by any rules of just reason- ing, return back from
the cause, and infer other effects from it, beyond those by which alone
it is known to us.

No one, merely from the sight of one of Zeuxis's pictures, could know,
that he was also a statuary or architect, and was an artist no less
skilful in stone and marble than in colours.

The talents and taste, displayed in the particular work before us;
these we may safely conclude the workman to be pos- sessed of. The cause
must be proportioned to the effect; and if we exactly and precisely
proportion it, we shall never find in it any qualities, that point
farther, or afford an inference concerning any other design or
performance.

Such qualities must be somewhat beyond what is merely requisite for
producing the effect, which we examine. Allowing, therefore, the gods to
be the authors of the existence or order of the universe; it follows,
that they possess that precise degree of power, intelligence, and
benevolence, which appears in their workmanship; but nothing farther can
ever be proved, except we call in the assistance of exaggeration and
flattery to supply the defects of argument and reasoning.

So far as the traces of any attributes, at present, appear, so far may
we conclude these attributes to exist.

The supposition of farther attributes is mere hypothesis; much more the
supposition, that, in distant regions of space or periods of time, there
has been, or will be, a more magnificent display of these attributes,
and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary virtues.
We can never be allowed to mount up from the universe, the effect, to
Jupiter, the cause; and then descend downwards, to infer any new effect
from that cause; as if the present effects alone were not entirely
worthy of the glorious attributes, which we ascribe to that deity.

The knowledge of the cause being derived solely from the effect, they
must be exactly adjusted to each other; and the one can never refer to
anything farther, or be the foundation of any new inference and
conclusion.

You find certain phenomena in nature.

You seek a cause or author.

You imagine that you have found him.

You afterwards become so enamoured of this offspring of your brain,
that you imagine it impossible, but he must produce something greater
and more perfect than the present scene of things, which is so full of
ill and disorder.

You forget, that this superlative intelligence and benevo- lence are
entirely imaginary, or, at least, without any foun- dation in reason;
and that you have no ground to ascribe to him any qualities, but what
you see he has actually exerted and displayed in his productions.

Let your gods, therefore, O philosophers, be suited to the present
appear- ances of nature: and presume not to alter these appearances by
arbitrary suppositions, in order to suit them to the at- tributes, which
you so fondly ascribe to your deities.

When priests and poets, supported by your authority, O Athenians, talk
of a golden or silver age, which preceded the present state of vice and
misery, I hear them with at- tention and with reverence.

But when philosophers, who pretend to neglect authority, and to
cultivate reason, hold the same discourse, I pay them not, I own, the
same ob- sequious submission and pious deference.

I ask; who carried them into the celestial regions, who admitted them
into the councils of the gods, who opened to them the book of fate, that
they thus rashly affirm, that their deities have executed, or will
execute, any purpose beyond what has actually appeared? If they tell me,
that they have mounted on the steps or by the gradual ascent of reason,
and by drawing inferences from effects to causes, I still insist,

that they have aided the ascent of reason by the wings of imagination;
otherwise they could not thus change their manner of inference, and
argue from causes to effects; presuming, that a more perfect production
than the present world would be more suitable to such perfect beings as
the gods, and forgetting that they have no reason to ascribe to these
celestial beings any perfection or any attribute, but what can be found
in the present world.

Hence all the fruitless industry to account for the ill appearances of
nature, and save the honour of the gods; while we must acknowledge the
reality of that evil and disorder, with which the world so much
abounds.

The obstinate and intractable qualities of matter, we are told, or the
observance of general laws, or some such reason, is the sole cause,
which controlled the power and benevo- lence of Jupiter, and obliged him
to create mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so
unhappy. These attributes then, are, it seems, beforehand, taken for
granted, in their greatest latitude.

And upon that supposition, I own that such conjectures may, perhaps, be
admitted as plausible solutions of the ill phenomena.

But still I ask; Why take these attributes for granted, or why ascribe
to the cause any qualities but what actually appear in the effect? Why
torture your brain to justify the course of nature upon suppositions,
which, for aught you know, may be entirely imaginary, and of which there
are to be found no traces in the course of nature? The religious
hypothesis, therefore, must be considered only as a particular method of
accounting for the visible phenomena of the universe: but no just
reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact, and alter
or add to the phenomena, in any single particular.

If you think, that the appearances of things prove such causes, it is
al- lowable for you to draw an inference concerning the exist- ence of
these causes.

In such complicated and sublime subjects, every one should be indulged
in the liberty of conjecture and argument. But here you ought to rest.

If you come backward, and arguing from your inferred causes, conclude,
that any other fact has existed, or will exist, in the course of nature,
which may serve as a fuller display of particular attributes; I must
admonish you, that you have departed from the method of reasoning,
attached to the present subject, and have certainly added something to
the attributes of the cause, beyond what appears in the effect;
otherwise you could never, with tolerable sense or propriety, add
anything to the effect, in order to render it more worthy of the
cause.

Where, then, is the odiousness of that doctrine, which I teach in my
school, or rather, which I examine in my gardens? Or what do you find in
this whole question, wherein the security of good morals, or the peace
and order of society, is in the least concerned? I deny a providence,
you say, and supreme governor of the world, who guides the course of
events, and punishes the vicious with infamy and disappointment, and
rewards the virtuous with honour and success, in all their under-
takings.

But surely, I deny not the course itself of events, which lies open to
every one's inquiry and examination.

I acknowledge, that, in the present order of things, virtue is attended
with more peace of mind than vice, and meets with a more favourable
reception from the world.

I am sensible, that, according to the past experience of mankind,
friendship is the chief joy of human life, and moderation the only
source of tranquillity and happiness. I never balance between the
virtuous and the vicious course of life; but am sensible, that, to a
well-disposed mind, every ad- vantage is on the side of the former.

And what can you say more, allowing all your suppositions and
reasonings? You tell me, indeed, that this disposition of things
proceeds from intelligence and design.

But whatever it proceeds from, the disposition itself, on which depends
our happiness or misery, and consequently our conduct and deportment in
life is still the same.

It is still open for me, as well as you, to regulate my behaviour, by
my experience of past events. And if you affirm, that, while a divine
providence is allowed and a supreme distributive justice in the
universe, I ought to expect some more particular reward of the good, and
punishment of the bad, beyond the ordinary course of events; I here find
the same fallacy, which I have before endeavoured to detect.

You persist in imagining, that, if we grant that divine existence, for
which you so earnestly contend, you may safely infer consequences from
it, and add something to the experienced order of nature, by arguing
from the attributes which you ascribe to your gods.

You seem not to remember, that all your reasonings on this subJect can
only be drawn from effects to causes; and that every argument, deducted
from causes to effects, must of necessity be a gross sophism; since it
is impossible for you to know anything of the cause, but what you have
antecedently, not inferred, but discovered to the full, in the effect.

But what must a philosopher think of those vain rea- soners, who
instead of regarding the present scene of things as the sole object of
their contemplation, so far reverse the whole course of nature, as to
render this life merely a passage to something farther; a porch, which
leads to a greater, and vastly different building; a prologue, which
serves only to introduce the piece, and give it more grace and
propriety? Whence, do you think, can such philoso- phers derive their
idea of the gods? From their own con- ceit and imagination surely.

For if they derived it from the present phenomena, it would never point
to anything farther, but must be exactly adjusted to them. That the
divinity may possibly be endowed with attributes, which we have never
seen exerted; may be governed by principles of action, which we cannot
discover to be satisfied: all this will freely be allowed.

But still this is mere possibility and hypothesis.

We never can have reason to infer any attributes, or any principles of
action in him, but so far as we know them to have been exerted and
satisfied. Are there any marks of a distributive justice in the world?
If you answer in the affirmative, I conclude, that, since justice here
exerts itself, it is satisfied.

If you reply in the negative, I conclude, that you have then no reason
to ascribe justice, in our sense of it, to the gods. If you hold a
medium between affirmation and negation, by saying, that the justice of
the gods, at present, exerts itself in part, but not in its full extent;
I answer, that you have no reason to give it any particular extent, but
only so far as you see it, at present, exert itself. Thus I bring the
dispute, O Athenians, to a short issue with my antagonists.

The course of nature lies open to my contemplation as well as to
theirs.

The experi- enced train of events is the great standard, by which we
all regulate our conduct.

Nothing else can be appealed to in the field, or in the senate.

Nothing else ought ever to be heard of in the school, or in the closet.
In vain would our limited understanding break through those boundaries,
which are too narrow for our fond imagination. While we argue from the
course of nature, and infer a particular intelligent cause, which first
bestowed, and still preserves order in the universe, we embrace a
principle, which is both uncertain and useless.

It is uncertain; be- cause the subject lies entirely beyond the reach
of human experience. It is useless; because our knowledge of this cause
being derived entirely from the course of nature, we can never,
according to the rules of just reasoning, return back from the cause
with any new inference, or making additions to the common and
experienced course of nature, establish any new principles of conduct
and be- haviour.

I observe (said I, finding he had finished his harangue) that you
neglect not the artifice of the demagogues of old; and as you were
pleased to make me stand for the people, you insinuate yourself into my
favour by embracing those principles, to which, you know, I have always
ex- pressed a particular attachment.

But allowing you to make experience (as indeed I think you ought) the
only standard of our judgement concerning this, and all other questions
of fact; I doubt not but, from the very same experience, to which you
appeal, it may be possible to refute this reasoning, which you have put
into the mouth of Epicurus.

If you saw, for instance, a half-finished building, surrounded with
heaps of brick and stone and mortar, and all the instruments of masonry;
could you not infer from the effect, that it was a work of design and
con- trivance? And could you not return again, from this in- ferred
cause, to infer new additions to the effect, and conclude, that the
building would soon be finished, and receive all the further
improvements, which art could be- stow upon it? If you saw upon the
sea-shore the print of one human foot, you would conclude, that a man
had passed that way, and that he had also left the traces of the other
foot, though effaced by the rolling of the sands or inundation of the
waters.

Why then do you refuse to admit the same method of reasoning with
regard to the order of nature? Consider the world and the present life
only as an imperfect building, from which you can infer a superior
intelligence; and arguing from that superior intelligence, which can
leave nothing imperfect; why may you not infer a more finished scheme or
plan, which will receive its completion in some distant point of space
or time? Are not these methods of reasoning exactly similar? And under
what pretence can you embrace the one, while you reject the other? The
infinite difference of the subjects, replied he, is a sufficient
foundation for this difference in my conclusions.

In works of human art and contrivance, it is allowable to advance from
the effect to the cause, and returning back from the cause, to form new
inferences concerning the effect, and examine the alterations, which it
has probably undergone, or may still undergo.

But what is the founda- tion of this method of reasoning? Plainly this;
that man is a being, whom we know by experience, whose motives and
designs we are acquainted with, and whose projects and inclinations have
a certain connexion and coherence, according to the laws which nature
has established for the government of such a creature.

When, therefore, we find, that any work has proceeded from the skill
and industry of man; as we are otherwise acquainted with the nature of
the animal, we can draw a hundred infer- ences concerning what may be
expected from him; and these inferences will all be founded in
experience and observation.

But did we know man only from the single work or production which we
examine, it were impossible for us to argue in this manner; because our
knowledge of all the qualities, which we ascribe to him, being in that
case derived from the production, it is impossible they could point to
anything farther, or be the foundation of any new inference.

The print of a foot in the sand can only prove, when considered alone,
that there was some figure adapted to it, by which it was produced: but
the print of a human foot proves likewise, from our other experience,
that there was probably another foot, which also left its impression,
though effaced by time or other accidents.

Here we mount from the effect to the cause; and descending again from
the cause, infer alterations in the effect; but this is not a
continuation of the same simple chain of reasoning.

We comprehend in this case a hundred other experiences and
observations, concerning the usual figure and members of that species of
animal, without which this method of argument must be considered as
fallacious and sophistical.

The case is not the same with our reasonings from the works of
nature.

The Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a single being
in the universe, not comprehended under any species or genus, from whose
experienced attributes or qualities, we can, by analogy, infer any
attribute or quality in him.

As the universe shews wisdom and goodness, we infer wisdom and good-
ness.

As it shews a particular degree of these perfections, we infer a
particular degree of them, precisely adapted to the effect which we
examine. But farther attributes or farther degrees of the same
attributes, we can never be authorised to infer or suppose, by any rules
of just rea- soning. Now, without some such licence of supposition, it
is impossible for us to argue from the cause, or infer any alteration in
the effect, beyond what has immediately fallen under our observation.

Greater good produced by this Being must still prove a greater degree
of goodness: a more impartial distribution of rewards and punishments
must proceed from a greater regard to justice and equity.

Every supposed addition to the works of nature makes an addition to the
attributes of the Author of nature; and consequently, being entirely
unsupported by any reason or argument, can never be admitted but as mere
conjecture and hypothesis.

[^4] The great source of our mistake in this subject, and of the
unbounded licence of conjecture, which we indulge, is, that we tacitly
consider ourselves, as in the place of the Supreme Being, and conclude,
that he will, on every occasion, observe the same conduct, which we
ourselves, in his situation, would have embraced as reasonable and
eligible.

But, besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us, that
almost everything is regulated by principles and maxims very different
from ours; besides this, I say, it must evidently appear contrary to all
rules of analogy to reason, from the intentions and projects of men, to
those of a Being so different, and so much su- perior.

In human nature, there is a certain experienced coherence of designs
and inclinations; so that when, from any fact, we have discovered one
intention of any man, it may often be reasonable, from experience, to
infer an- other, and draw a long chain of conclusions concerning his
past or future conduct.

But this method of reasoning can never have place with regard to a
Being, so remote and in- comprehensible, who bears much less analogy to
any other being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and who
discovers himself only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond which we
have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection.

What we imagine to be a superior perfection, may really be a defect.

Or were it ever so much a perfection, the ascribing of it to the
Supreme Being, where it appears not to have been really exerted, to the
full, in his works, savours more of flattery and panegyric, than of just
reasoning and sound philosophy.

All the philo- sophy, therefore, in the world, and all the religion,
which is nothing but a species of philosophy, will never be able to
carry us beyond the usual course of experience, or give us measures of
conduct and behaviour different from those which are furnished by
reflections on common life.

No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious hypothesis; no
event foreseen or foretold; no reward or punishment ex- pected or
dreaded, beyond what is already known by practice and observation.

So that my apology for Epicurus will still appear solid and
satisfactory; nor have the political inter- ests of society any
connexion with the philosophical dis- putes concerning metaphysics and
religion.

There is still one circumstance, replied I, which you seem to have
overlooked. Though I should allow your premises, I must deny your
conclusion.

You conclude, that religious doctrines and reasonings can have no
influence on life, because they ought to have no influence; never con-
sidering, that men reason not in the same manner you do, but draw many
consequences from the belief of a divine Existence, and suppose that the
Deity will inflict punish- ments on vice, and bestow rewards on virtue,
beyond what appear in the ordinary course of nature. Whether this
reasoning of theirs be just or not, is no matter.

Its influence on their life and conduct must still be the same. And
those, who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudices, may, for aught I
know, be good reasoners, but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and
politicians; since they free men from one restraint upon their passions,
and make the infringement of the laws of society, in one respect, more
easy and secure.

After all, I may, perhaps, agree to your general conclusion in favour
of liberty, though upon different premises from those, on which you
endeavour to found it. I think, that the state ought to tolerate every
principle of philosophy; nor is there an instance, that any government
has suffered in its political interests by such indulgence.

There is no enthusiasm among philosophers; their doctrines are not very
alluring to the people; and no restraint can be put upon their
reasonings, but what must be of dangerous con- sequence to the sciences,
and even to the state, by paving the way for persecution and oppression
in points, where the generality of mankind are more deeply interested
and concerned.

But there occurs to me (continued I) with regard to your main topic, a
difficulty, which I shall just propose to you without insisting on it;
lest it lead into reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature.

In a word, I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be known
only by its effect (as you have all along supposed) or to be of so
singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no
similarity with any other cause or object, that has ever fallen under
our observation. It is only when two species of objects are found to be
constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other; and were
an effect presented, which was entirely singular, and could not be
comprehended under any known species, I do not see, that we could form
any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause.

If experience and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides
which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature; both the
effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effects
and causes, which we know, and which we have found, in many instances,
to be con- joined with each other.

I leave it to your own reflection to pursue the consequences of this
principle.

I shall just observe, that, as the antagonists of Epicurus always sup-
pose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the
proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and un- paralleled; your
reasonings, upon that supposition, seem, at least, to merit our
attention. There is, I own, some dif- ficulty, how we can ever return
from the cause to the effect, and, reasoning from our ideas of the
former, infer any alteration on the latter, or any, addition to it.

[^1] Luciani, [3 greek words].

[^4] In general, it may, I think, Be established as a maxim, that where
any cause is known only by its particular effects, it must be impossible
to infer any new effects from that cause; since the qualities, which are
requisite to produce these new effects along with the former, must
either be different, or superior, or of more extensive operation, than
those which simply pro- duced the effect, whence alone the cause is
supposed to be known to us.

We can never, therefore, have any reason to suppose the existence of
these qualities. To say, that the new effects proceed only from a
continuation of the same energy, which is already known from the first
effects, will not remove the difficulty.

For even granting this to be the case (which can seldom be supposed),
the very continuation and exertion of a like energy (for it is
impossible it can be absolutely the same), I say, this exertion of a
like energy, in a different period of space and time, is a very
arbitrary supposition, and what there cannot possibly be any traces of
it in the effects, from which all our knowledge of the cause is
originally derived.

Let the inferred cause be exactly proportioned (as it should be) to the
known effect; and it is impossible that it can possess any qualities,
from which new or different effects can be inferred.
