Section Viii : of Llberity and Necessity
========================================

PART I IT might reasonably be expected in questions which have been
canvassed and disputed with great eagerness, since the first origin of
science, and philosophy, that the meaning of all the terms, at least,
should have been agreed upon among the disputants; and our enquiries, in
the course of two thousand years, been able to pass from words to the
true and real subject of the controversy.

For how easy may it seem to give exact definitions of the terms
employed in reasoning, and make these definitions, not the mere sound of
words, the object of future scrutiny and examination? But if we consider
the matter more narrowly, we shall be apt to draw a quite opposite
conclusion. From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been
long kept on foot, and remains still undecided, we may presume that
there is some ambiguity in the expression, and that the disputants affix
different ideas to the terms employed in the controversy.

For as the faculties of the mind are supposed to be naturally alike in
every individual; otherwise nothing could be more fruitless than to
reason or dispute together; it were impossible, if men affix the same
ideas to their terms, that they could so long form different opinions of
the same subject; especially when they communicate their views, and each
party turn themselves on all sides, in search of arguments which may
give them the victory over their antagonists.

It is true, if men attempt the discussion of questions which lie
entirely beyond the reach of human capacity, such as those concerning
the origin of worlds, or the economy of the intellectual system or
region of spirits, they may long beat the air in their fruitless
contests, and never arrive at any determinate conclusion. But if the
question regard any subject of common life and experience, nothing, one
would think, could preserve the dispute so long undecided but some
ambiguous expressions, which keep the antagonists still at a distance,
and hinder them from grappling with each other.

This has been the case in the long disputed question concerning liberty
and necessity; and to so remarkable a degree that, if I be not much
mistaken, we shall find, that all mankind, both learned and ignorant,
have always been of the same opinion with regard to this subject, and
that a few intelligible definitions would immediately have put an end to
the whole controversy.

I own that this dispute has been so much canvassed on all hands, and
has led philosophers into such a labyrinth of obscure sophistry, that it
is no wonder, if a sensible reader indulge his ease so far as to turn a
deaf ear to the proposal of such a question, from which he can expect
neither instruction or entertain- ment.

But the state of the argument here proposed may, perhaps, serve to
renew his attention; as it has more novelty, promises at least some
decision of the controversy, and will not much disturb his ease by any
intricate or obscure reasoning.

I hope, therefore, to make it appear that all men have ever agreed in
the doctrine both of necessity and of liberty, according to any
reasonable sense, which can be put on these terms; and that the whole
controversy, has hitherto turned merely upon words. We shall begin with
examining the doctrine of necessity.

It is universally allowed that matter, in all its operations, is
actuated by a necessary force, and that every natural effect is so
precisely determined by the energy of its cause that no other effect, in
such particular circumstances, could possibly have resulted from it. The
degree and direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature,
prescribed with such exactness that a living creature may as soon arise
from the shock of two bodies as motion in any other de- gree or
direction than what is actually produced by it.

Would we, therefore, form a just and precise idea of neces- sity, we
must consider whence that idea arises when we apply it to the operation
of bodies. It seems evident that, if all the scenes of nature were
continually shifted in such a manner that no two events bore any
resemblance to each other, but every object was entirely new, without
any similitude to whatever had been seen before, we should never, in
that case, have attained the least idea of necessity, or of a connexion
among these objects.

We might say, upon such a supposition, that one object or event has
followed another; not that one was produced by the other. The relation
of cause and effect must be utterly unknown to mankind.

Inference and rea- soning concerning the operations of nature would,
from that moment, be at an end; and the memory and senses remain the
only canals, by which the knowledge of any real existence could possibly
have access to the mind. Our idea, therefore, of necessity and causation
arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the operations of
nature, where similar objects are constantly conjoined together, and the
mind is determined by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the
other. These two circum- stances form the whole of that necessity, which
we ascribe to matter.

Beyond the constant conjunction of similar objects, and the consequent
inference from one to the other, we have no notion of any necessity or
connexion.

If it appear, therefore, that all mankind have ever allowed, without
any doubt or hesitation, that these two circum- stances take place in
the voluntary actions of men, and in the operations of mind; it must
follow, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of necessity,
and that they have hitherto disputed, merely for not understanding each
other.

As to the first circumstance, the constant and regular con- junction of
similar events, we may possibly satisfy ourselves by the following
considerations: It is universally acknowl- edged that there is a great
uniformity among the actions of men, in all nations and ages, and that
human nature remains still the same, in its principles and operations.

The same motives always produce the same actions: the same events
follow from the same causes. Ambition, avarice, self-love, vanity,
friendship, generosity, public spirit: these passions, mixed in various
degrees, and distributed through society, have been, from the beginning
of the world, and still are, the source of all the actions and
enterprises, which have ever been observed among mankind.

Would you know the sentiments, inclinations, and course of life of the
Greeks and Romans? Study well the temper and actions of the French and
English: You cannot be much mistaken in trans- ferring to the former
most of the observations which you have made with regard to the latter.
Mankind are so much the same, in all times and places, that history
informs us of nothing new or strange in this particular.

Its chief use is only to discover the constant and universal principles
of human nature, by showing men in all varieties of circum- stances and
situations, and furnishing us with materials from which we may form our
observations and become ac- quainted with the regular springs of human
action and be- haviour.

These records of wars, intrigues, factions, and revolutions, are so
many collections of experiments, by which the politician or moral
philosopher fixes the prin- ciples of his science, in the same manner as
the physician or natural philosopher becomes acquainted with the nature
of plants, minerals, and other external objects, by the ex- periments
which he forms concerning them.

Nor are the earth, water, and other elements, examined by Aristotle,
and Hippocrates, more like to those which at present lie under our
observation than the men described by Polybius and Tacitus are to those
who now govern the world.

Should a traveller, returning from a far country, bring us an account
of men, wholly different from any with whom we were ever acquainted;
men, who were entirely divested of avarice, ambition, or revenge; who
knew no pleasure but friendship, generosity, and public spirit; we
should immedi- ately, from these circumstances, detect the falsehood,
and prove him a liar, with the same certainty as if he had stuffed his
narration with stories of centaurs and dragons, miracles and
prodigies.

And if we would explode any forgery in history, we cannot make use of a
more convincing argu- ment, than to prove, that the actions ascribed to
any person are directly contrary to the course of nature, and that no
human motives, in such circumstances, could ever induce him to such a
conduct. The veracity of Quintus Curtius is as much to be suspected,
when he describes the super- natural courage of Alexander, by which he
was hurried on singly to attack multitudes, as when he describes his
super- natural force and activity, by which he was able to resist
them.

So readily and universally do we acknowledge a uni- formity in human
motives and actions as well as in the operations of body. Hence likewise
the benefit of that experience, acquired by long life and a variety of
business and company, in order to instruct us in the principles of human
nature, and regu- late our future conduct, as well as speculation.

By means of this guide, we mount up to the knowledge of men's in-
clinations and motives, from their actions, expressions, and even
gestures; and again descend to the interpretation of their actions from
our knowledge of their motives and in- clinations. The general
observations treasured up by a course of experience, give us the clue of
human nature, and teach us to unravel all its intricacies. Pretexts and
appear- ances no longer deceive us.

Public declarations pass for the specious colouring of a cause. And
though virtue and honour be allowed their proper weight and authority,
that perfect disinterestedness, so often pretended to, is never ex-
pected in multitudes and parties; seldom in their leaders; and scarcely
even in individuals of any rank or station. But were there no uniformity
in human actions, and were every experiment which we could form of this
kind irregular and anomalous, it were impossible to collect any general
observa- tions concerning mankind; and no experience, however ac-
curately digested by reflection, would ever serve to any purpose.

Why is the aged husbandman more skilful in his calling than the young
beginner but because there is a certain uniformity in the operation of
the sun, rain, and earth towards the production of vegetables; and
experience teaches the old practitioner the rules by which this
operation is governed and directed.

We must not, however, expect that this uniformity of human actions
should be carried to such a length as that all men, in the same
circumstances, will always act precisely in the same manner, without
making any allowance for the diversity of characters, prejudices, and
opinions. Such a uniformity in every particular, is found in no part of
nature.

On the contrary, from observing the variety of conduct in different
men, we are enabled to form a greater variety of maxims, which still
suppose a degree of uniformity and regularity.

Are the manners of men different in different ages and countries? We
learn thence the great force of custom and education, which mould the
human mind from its infancy and form it into a fixed and established
character.

Is the behaviour and conduct of the one sex very unlike that of the
other? Is it thence we become acquainted with the different characters
which nature has impressed upon the sexes, and which she preserves with
constancy and regu- larity? Are the actions of the same person much
diversified in the different periods of his life, from infancy to old
age? This affords room for many general observations concerning the
gradual change of our sentiments and inclinations, and the different
maxims which prevail in the different ages of human creatures.

Even the characters, which are peculiar to each individual, have a
uniformity in their influence; otherwise our acquaintance with the
persons and our obser- vation of their conduct could never teach us
their disposi- tions, or serve to direct our behaviour with regard to
them. I grant it possible to find some actions, which seem to have no
regular connexion with any known motives, and are exceptions to all the
measures of conduct which have ever been established for the government
of men.

But if we would willingly know what judgment should be formed of such
irregular and extraordinary actions, we may con- sider the sentiments
commonly entertained with regard to those irregular events which appear
in the course of nature, and the operations of external objects. All
causes are not conjoined to their usual effects with like uniformity. An
artificer, who handles only dead matter, may be disappointed of his aim,
as well as the politician, who directs the conduct of sensible and
intelligent agents.

The vulgar, who take things according to their first ap- pearance,
attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the causes
as makes the latter often fail of their usual influence; though they
meet with no impedi- ment in their operation. But philosophers,
observing that, almost in every part of nature, there is contained a
vast variety of springs and principles, which are hid, by reason of
their minuteness or remoteness, find, that it is at least possible the
contrariety of events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause,
but from the secret operation of contrary causes.

This possibility is converted into cer- tainty by farther observation,
when they remark that, upon an exact scrutiny, a contrariety of effects
always betrays a contrariety of causes, and proceeds from their mutual
opposition.

A peasant can give no better reason for the stopping of any clock or
watch than to say that it does not commonly go right: But an artist
easily perceives that the same force in the spring or pendulum has
always the same influence on the wheels; but fails of its usual effects,
perhaps by reason of a grain of dust, which puts a stop to the whole
movement.

From the observation of several parallel instances, philosophers form a
maxim that the connexion between all causes and effects is equally
necessary, and that its seeming uncertainty in some instances proceeds
from the secret opposition of contrary causes.

Thus, for instance, in the human body, when the usual symptoms of
health or sickness disappoint our expectation; when medicines operate
not with their wonted powers; when irregular events follow from any
particular cause; the philosopher and physician are not surprised at the
matter, nor are ever tempted to deny, in general, the necessity and
uniformity of those principles by which the animal economy is
conducted.

They know that a human body is a mighty complicated machine: That many
secret powers lurk in it, which are altogether beyond our comprehension:
That to us it must often appear very uncertain in its operations: And
that therefore the irregular events, which outwardly discover
themselves, can be no proof that the laws of nature are not observed
with the greatest regularity in its internal operations and government.
The philosopher, if he be consistent, must apply the same reasoning to
the actions and volitions of intelligent agents.

The most irregular and unexpected resolutions of men may frequently be
accounted for by those who know every par- ticular circumstance of their
character and situation. A person of an obliging disposition gives a
peevish answer: But he has the toothache, or has not dined. A stupid
fellow discovers an uncommon alacrity in his carriage: But he has met
with a sudden piece of good fortune. Or even when an action, as
sometimes happens, cannot be particularly ac- counted for, either by the
person himself or by others; we know, in general, that the characters of
men are, to a certain degree, inconstant and irregular.

This is, in a manner, the constant character of human nature; though it
be appli- cable, in a more particular manner, to some persons who have
no fixed rule for their conduct, but proceed in a con- tinued course of
caprice and inconstancy.

The internal principles and motives may operate in a uniform manner,
notwithstanding these seeming irregularities; in the same manner as the
winds, rain, cloud, and other variations of the weather are supposed to
be governed by steady prin- ciples; though not easily discoverable by
human sagacity and enquiry.

Thus it appears, not only that the conjunction between motives and
voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the cause
and effect in any part of nature; but also that this regular conjunction
has been universally acknowledged among mankind, and has never been the
subject of dispute, either in philosophy or common life.

Now, as it is from past experience that we draw all infer- ences
concerning the future, and as we conclude that objects will always be
conjoined together which we find to have always been conjoined; it may
seem superfluous to prove that this experienced uniformity in human
actions is a source whence we draw inferences concerning them.

But in order to throw the argument into a greater variety of lights we
shall also insist, though briefly, on this latter topic. The mutual
dependence of men is so great in all societies that scarce any human
action is entirely complete in itself, or is performed without some
reference to the actions of others, which are requisite to make it
answer fully the in- tention of the agent. The poorest artificer, who
labours alone, expects at least the protection of the magistrate, to
ensure him the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour.

He also expects that, when he carries his goods to market, and offers
them at a reasonable price, he shall find purchasers, and shall be able,
by the money he acquires, to engage others to supply him with those
commodities which are requisite for his subsistence. In proportion as
men extend their deal- ings, and render their intercourse with others
more com- plicated, they always comprehend, in their schemes of life, a
greater variety of voluntary actions, which they expect, from the proper
motives, to co-operate with their own.

In all these conclusions they take their measures from past ex-
perience, in the same manner as in their reasonings con- cerning
external objects; and firmly believe that men, as well as all the
elements, are to continue, in their operations, the same that they have
ever found them. A manufacturer reckons upon the labour of his servants
for the execution of any work as much as upon the tools which he
employs, and would be equally surprised were his expectations dis-
appointed.

In short, this experimental inference and rea- soning concerning the
actions of others enters so much into human life that no man, while
awake, is ever a moment without employing it. Have we not reason,
therefore, to affirm that all mankind have always agreed in the doctrine
of necessity according to the foregoing definition and ex- plication of
it? Nor have philosophers even entertained a different opinion from the
people in this particular. For, not to men- tion that almost every
action of their life supposes that opinion, there are even few of the
speculative parts of learn- ing to which it is not essential.

What would become of history, had we not a dependence on the veracity
of the historian according to the experience which we have had of
mankind? How could politics be a science, if laws and forms of
government had not a uniform influence upon society? Where would be the
foundation of morals, if par- ticular characters had no certain or
determinate power to produce particular sentiments, and if these
sentiments had no constant operation on actions? And with what pretence
could we employ our criticism upon any poet or polite author, if we
could not pronounce the conduct and sentiments of his actors either
natural or unnatural to such characters, and in such circumstances? It
seems almost impossible, therefore, to engage either in science or
action of any kind without acknowledging the doctrine of necessity, and
this inference from motive to voluntary actions, from characters to
conduct.

And indeed, when we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence link
together, and form only one chain of argument, we shall make no scruple
to allow that they are of the same nature, and derived from the same
principles.

A prisoner who has neither money nor interest, discovers the
impossibility of his escape, as well when he considers the obstinacy of
the gaoler, as the walls and bars with which he is surrounded; and, in
all attempts for his freedom, chooses rather to work upon the stone and
iron of the one, than upon the inflexible nature of the other. The same
prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees his death as
certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards, as from the
operation of the axe or wheel.

His mind runs along a certain train of ideas: the refusal of the
soldiers to consent to his escape; the action of the executioner; the
separation of the head and body; bleeding, convulsive motions, and
death.

Here is a connected chain of natural causes and voluntary actions; but
the mind feels no differ- ence between them in passing from one link to
another: Nor is it less certain of the future event than if it were con-
nected with the objects present to the memory or senses, by a train of
causes, cemented together by what we are pleased to call a physical
necessity.

The same experienced union has the same effect on the mind, whether the
united objects be motives, volition, and actions; or figure and motion.
We may change the name of things; but their nature and their operation
on the understanding never change. Were a man, whom I know to be honest
and opulent, and with whom I live in intimate friendship, to come into
my house, where I am surrounded with my servants, I rest assured that he
is not to stab me before he leaves it in order to rob me of my silver
standish; and I no more suspect this event than the falling of the house
itself, which is new, and solidly built and founded. --But he may have
been seized with a sudden and unknown frenzy.

--So may a sudden earthquake arise, and shake and tumble my house about
my ears. I shall therefore change the suppositions.

I shall say that I know with certainty that he is not to put his hand
into the fire and hold it there till it be consumed: and this event, I
think I can foretell with the same assurance, as that, if he throw
himself out at the window, and meet with no obstruction, he will not
remain a moment suspended in the air.

No suspicion of an unknown frenzy can give the least possibility to the
former event, which is so con- trary to all the known principles of
human nature.

A man who at noon leaves his purse full of gold on the pavement at
Charing-Cross, may as well expect that it will fly away like a feather,
as that he will find it untouched an hour after.

Above one half of human reasonings contain inferences of a similar
nature, attended with more or less degrees of cer- tainty proportioned
to our experience of the usual conduct of mankind in such particular
situations. I have frequently considered, what could possibly be the
reason why all mankind, though they have ever, without hesitation,
acknowledged the doctrine of necessity in their whole practice and
reasoning, have yet discovered such a reluctance to acknowledge it in
words, and have rather shown a propensity, in all ages, to profess the
contrary opinion.

The matter, I think, may be accounted for after the following manner.
If we examine the operations of body, and the production of effects from
their causes, we shall find that all our faculties can never carry us
farther in our knowledge of this relation than barely to observe that
particular objects are constantly conjoined together, and that the mind
is carried, by a customary transition, from the appearance of one to the
belief of the other.

But though this conclusion concerning human ignorance be the result of
the strictest scrutiny of this subject, men still entertain a strong
propensity to believe that they penetrate farther into the powers of
nature, and perceive something like a necessary connexion between the
cause and the effect.

When again they turn their reflections towards the opera- tions of
their own minds, and feel no such connexion of the motive and the
action; they are thence apt to suppose, that there is a difference
between the effects which result from material force, and those which
arise from thought and intelligence.

But being once convinced that we know nothing farther of causation of
any kind than merely the constant conjunction of objects, and the
consequent inference of the mind from one to another, and finding that
these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in
voluntary actions; we may be more easily led to own the same necessity
common to all causes.

And though this reasoning may contradict the systems of many
philosophers, in ascribing necessity to the determinations of the will,
we shall find, upon reflection, that they dissent from it in words only,
not in their real sentiment.

Necessity, according to the sense in which it is here taken, has never
yet been rejected, nor can ever, I think, be rejected by any
philosopher. It may only, perhaps, be pretended that the mind can per-
ceive, in the operations of matter, some farther connexion between the
cause and effect; and connexion that has not place in voluntary actions
of intelligent beings.

Now whether it be so or not, can only appear upon examination; and it
is incumbent on these philosophers to make good their assertion, by
defining or describing that necessity, and pointing it out to us in the
operations of material causes.

It would seem, indeed, that men begin at the wrong end of this question
concerning liberty and necessity, when they enter upon it by examining
the faculties of the soul, the influence of the understanding, and the
operations of the will.

Let them first discuss a more simple question, namely, the operations
of body and of brute unintelligent matter; and try whether they can
there form any idea of causation and necessity, except that of a
constant conjunc- tion of objects, and subsequent inference of the mind
from one to another. If these circumstances form, in reality, the whole
of that necessity, which we conceive in matter, and if these
circumstances be also universally acknowledged to take place in the
operations of the mind, the dispute is at an end; at least, must be
owned to be thenceforth merely verbal.

But as long as we will rashly suppose, that we have some farther idea
of necessity and causation in the opera- tions of external objects; at
the same time, that we can find nothing farther in the voluntary actions
of the mind; there is no possibility of bringing the question to any
determinate issue, while we proceed upon so erroneous a supposition.

The only method of undeceiving us is to mount up higher; to examine the
narrow extent of science when applied to material causes; and to
convince ourselves that all we know of them is the constant conjunction
and inference above mentioned. We may, perhaps, find that it is with
dif- ficulty we are induced to fix such narrow limits to human
understanding: but we can afterwards find no difficulty when we come to
apply this doctrine to the actions of the will.

For as it is evident that these have a regular con- junction with
motives and circumstances and characters, and as we always draw
inferences from one to the other, we must be obliged to acknowledge in
words that necessity, which we have already avowed, in every
deliberation of our lives, and in every step of our conduct and
behaviour.

[^1] But to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the
question of liberty and necessity; the most contentious question of
metaphysics, the most contentious science; it will not require many
words to prove, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of
liberty as well as in that of necessity, and that the whole dispute, in
this respect also, has been hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by
liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We cannot surely mean that
actions have so little connexion with motives, inclinations, and
circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of
uniformity from the other, and that one affords no inference by which we
can conclude the existence of the other.

For these are plain and acknowl- edged matters of fact. By liberty,
then, we can only mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the
determin- ations of the will; this is, if we choose to remain at rest,
we may; if we choose to move, we also may.

Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every
one who is not a prisoner and in chains. Here, then, is no subject of
dispute.

Whatever definition we may give of liberty, we should be careful to
observe two requisite circumstances; First, that it be consistent with
plain matter of fact; secondly, that it be consistent with itself. If we
observe these circum- stances, and render our definition intelligible, I
am per- suaded that all mankind will be found of one opinion with regard
to it.

It is universally allowed that nothing exists without a cause of its
existence, and that chance, when strictly ex- amined, is a mere negative
word, and means not any real power which has anywhere a being in nature.
But it is pretended that some causes are necessary, some not neces-
sary. Here then is the advantage of definitions.

Let any one define a cause, without comprehending, as a part of the
definition, a necessary connexion with its effect; and let him show
distinctly the origin of the idea, expressed by the definition; and I
shall readily give up the whole con- troversy. But if the foregoing
explication of the matter be received, this must be absolutely
impracticable.

Had not objects a regular conjunction with each other, we should never
have entertained any notion of cause and effect; and this regular
conjunction produces that inference of the understanding, which is the
only connexion, that we can have any comprehension of. Whoever attempts
a defi- nition of cause, exclusive of these circumstances, will be
obliged either to employ unintelligible terms or such as are synonymous
to the term which he endeavours to define.

[^2] And if the definition above mentioned be admitted; liberty, when
opposed to necessity, not to constraint, is the same thing with chance;
which is universally allowed to have no existence.

PART II THERE is no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more
blameable, than, in philosophical disputes, to endeavour the refutation
of any hypothesis, by a pre- tence of its dangerous consequences to
religion and mor- ality. When any opinion leads to absurdities, it is
cer- tainly false; but it is not certain that an opinion is false,
because it is of dangerous consequence.

Such topics, there- fore, ought entirely to be forborne; as serving
nothing to the discovery of truth, but only to make the person of an
antagonist odious.

This I observe in general, without pre- tending to draw any advantage
from it. I frankly submit to an examination of this kind, and shall
venture to affirm that the doctrines, both of necessity and of liberty,
as above explained, are not only consistent with morality, but are
absolutely essential to its support.

Necessity may be defined two ways, conformably to the two definitions
of cause, of which it makes an essential part. It consists either in the
constant conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of the
understanding from one object to another. Now necessity, in both these
senses, (which, indeed, are at bottom the same) has universally, though
tacitly, in the schools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been allowed
to belong to the will of man; and no one has ever pretended to deny that
we can draw inferences concerning human actions, and that those
inferences are founded on the experienced union of like actions, with
like motives, inclinations, and circumstances.

The only par- ticular in which any one can differ, is, that either,
perhaps, he will refuse to give the name of necessity to this property
of human actions: but as long as the meaning is understood, I hope the
word can do no harm: or that he will maintain it possible to discover
something farther in the operations of matter.

But this, it must be acknowledged, can be of no consequence to morality
or religion, whatever it may be to natural philosophy or metaphysics. We
may here be mistaken in asserting that there is no idea of any other
necessity or connexion in the actions of body: But surely we ascribe
nothing to the actions of the mind, but what everyone does, and must
readily allow of.

We change no circumstance in the received orthodox system with regard
to the will, but only in that with regard to material objects and
causes. Nothing, therefore, can be more innocent, at least, than this
doctrine.

All laws being founded on rewards and punishments, it is supposed as a
fundamental principle, that these motives have a regular and uniform
influence on the mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil
actions. We may give to this influence what name we please; but, as it
is usually conjoined with the action, it must be esteemed a cause, and
be looked upon as an instance of that necessity, which we would here
establish.

The only proper object of hatred or vengeance is a person or creature,
endowed with thought and conscious- ness; and when any criminal or
injurious actions excite that passion, it is only by their relation to
the person, or connexion with him. Actions are, by their very nature,
temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some cause in
the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can
neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil.

The actions themselves may be blameable; they may be contrary to all
the rules of morality and religion: but the person is not answerable for
them; and as they proceeded from nothing in him that is durable and
constant, and leave nothing of that nature behind them, it is impossible
he can, upon their account, become the object of punishment or
vengeance.

According to the principle, therefore, which denies necessity, and
consequently causes, a man is as pure and untainted, after having
committed the most horrid crime, as at the first moment of his birth,
nor is his character anywise concerned in his actions, since they are
not derived from it, and the wickedness of the one can never be used as
a proof of the depravity of the other.

Men are not blamed for such actions as they perform ignorantly and
casually, whatever may be the consequences. Why? but because the
principles of these actions are only momentary, and terminate in them
alone.

Men are less blamed for such actions as they perform hastily and unpre-
meditatedly than for such as proceed from deliberation. For what reason?
but because a hasty temper, though a constant cause or principle in the
mind, operates only by intervals, and infects not the whole character.
Again, repentance wipes off every crime, if attended with a reformation
of life and manners.

How is this to be accounted for? but by asserting that actions render a
person criminal merely as they are proofs of criminal principles in the
mind; and when, by an alteration of these principles, they cease to be
just proofs, they likewise cease to be criminal.

But, except upon the doctrine of necessity, they never were just
proofs, and consequently never were criminal. It will be equally easy to
prove, and from the same arguments, that liberty, according to that
definition above mentioned, in which all men agree, is also essential to
morality, and that no human actions, where it is wanting, are
susceptible of any moral qualities, or can be the objects either of
approbation or dislike.

For as actions are objects of our moral sentiment, so far only as they
are indications of the internal character, passions, and affections; it
is impossible that they can give rise either to praise or blame, where
they proceed not from these principles, but are derived altogether from
external violence.

I pretend not to have obviated or removed all objections to this
theory, with regard to necessity and liberty. I can foresee other
objections, derived from topics which have not here been treated of. It
may be said, for instance, that, if voluntary actions be subjected to
the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter, there is a
continued chain of necessary causes, pre-ordained and pre-determined,
reaching from the original cause of all to every single volition of
every human creature.


No contingency any- where in the universe; no indifference; no liberty.
While we act, we are, at the same time, acted upon.

The ulti- mate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of the world,
who first bestowed motion on this immense machine, and placed all beings
in that particular position, whence every subsequent event, by an
inevitable necessity, must result. Human actions, therefore, either can
have no moral turpitude at all, as proceeding from so good a cause; or
if they have any turpitude, they must involve our Creator in the same
guilt, while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cause and author.

For as a man, who fired a mine, is answerable for all the consequences
whether the train he employed be long or short; so wherever a continued
chain of necessary causes is fixed, that Being, either finite or
infinite, who produces the first, is likewise the author of all the
rest, and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong
to them.

Our clear and unalterable ideas of morality establish this rule, upon
unquestionable reasons, when we examine the consequences of any human
action; and these reasons must still have greater force when applied to
the volitions and intentions of a Being infinitely wise and powerful.
Ignorance or impotence may be pleaded for so limited a creature as man;
but those imperfections have no place in our Creator. He foresaw, he
ordained, he intended all those actions of men, which we so rashly
pronounce criminal.

And we must there- fore conclude, either that they are not criminal, or
that the Deity, not man, is accountable for them. But as either of these
positions is absurd and impious, it follows, that the doctrine from
which they are deduced cannot possibly be true, as being liable to all
the same objections.

An absurd consequence, if necessary, proves the original doctrine to be
absurd; in the same manner as criminal actions render crimi- nal the
original cause, if the connexion between them be necessary and
inevitable.

This objection consists of two parts, which we shall examine
separately; First, that, if human actions can be traced up, by a
necessary chain, to the Deity, they can never be criminal; on account of
the infinite perfection of that Being from whom they are derived, and
who can intend nothing but what is altogether good and laudable.

Or, Secondly, if they be criminal, we must retract the attribute of
perfection, which we ascribe to the Deity, and must acknowledge him to
be the ultimate author of guilt and moral turpitude in all his
creatures.
The answer to the first objection seems obvious and con- vincing.

There are many philosophers who, after an exact scrutiny of all the
phenomena of nature, conclude, that the WHOLE, considered as one system,
is, in every period of its existence, ordered with perfect benevolence;
and that the utmost possible happiness will, in the end, result to all
created beings, without any mixture of positive or absolute ill or
misery.

Every physical ill, say they, makes an essen- tial part of this
benevolent system, and could not possibly be removed, even by the Deity
himself, considered as a wise agent, without giving entrance to greater
ill, or ex- cluding greater good, which will result from it. From this
theory, some philosophers, and the ancient Stoics among the rest,
derived a topic of consolation under all afflictions, while they taught
their pupils that those ills under which they laboured were, in reality,
goods to the universe; and that to an enlarged view, which could
comprehend the whole system of nature, every event became an object of
joy and exultation.

But though this topic be specious and sublime, it was soon found in
practice weak and inef- fectual. You would surely more irritate than
appease a man lying under the racking pains of the gout by preaching up
to him the rectitude of those general laws, which pro- duced the
malignant humours in his body, and led them through the proper canals,
to the sinews and nerves, where they now excite such acute torments.

These enlarged views may, for a moment, please the imagination of a
speculative man, who is placed in ease and security; but neither can
they dwell with constancy on his mind, even though undisturbed by the
emotions of pain or passion; much less can they maintain their ground
when attacked by such powerful antagonists.

The affections take a nar- rower and more natural survey of their
object; and by an economy, more suitable to the infirmity of human
minds, regard alone the beings around us, and are actuated by such
events as appear good or ill to the private system. The case is the same
with moral as with physical ill.

It cannot reasonably be supposed, that those remote consid- erations,
which are found of so little efficacy with regard to one, will have a
more powerful influence with regard to the other.

The mind of man is so formed by nature that, upon the appearance of
certain characters, dispositions, and actions, it immediately feels the
sentiment of appro- bation or blame; nor are there any emotions more
essential to its frame and constitution. The characters which engage our
approbation are chiefly such as contribute to the peace and security of
human society; as the characters which excite blame are chiefly such as
tend to public detriment and disturbance: whence it may reasonably be
presumed, that the moral sentiments arise, either mediately or im-
mediately, from a reflection of these opposite interests.

What though philosophical meditations establish a different opinion or
conjecture; that everything is right with regard to the WHOLE, and that
the qualities, which disturb society, are, in the main, as beneficial,
and are as suitable to the primary intention of nature as those which
more directly promote its happiness and welfare? Are such remote and
uncertain speculations able to counterbalance the senti- ments which
arise from the natural and immediate view of the objects?

A man who is robbed of a considerable sum; does he find his vexation
for the loss anywise diminished by these sublime reflections? Why then
should his moral resentment against the crime be supposed incompatible
with them? Or why should not the acknowledgment of a real distinction
between vice and virtue be reconcileable to all speculative systems of
philosophy, as well as that of a real distinction between personal
beauty and deformity? Both these distinctions are founded in the natural
senti- ments of the human mind: And these sentiments are not to be
controuled or altered by any philosophical theory or speculation
whatsoever.

The second objection admits not of so easy and satis- factory an
answer; nor is it possible to explain distinctly, how the Deity can be
the mediate cause of all the actions of men, without being the author of
sin and moral turpitude.

These are mysteries, which mere natural and unassisted reason is very
unfit to handle; and whatever system she embraces, she must find herself
involved in inextricable difficulties, and even contradictions, at every
step which she takes with regard to such subjects. To reconcile the in-
difference and contingency of human actions with prescience; or to
defend absolute decrees, and yet free the Deity from being the author of
sin, has been found hitherto to exceed all the power of philosophy.

Happy, if she be thence sensible of her temerity, when she pries into
these sublime mysteries; and leaving a scene so full of obscurities and
perplexities, return, with suitable modesty, to her true and proper
province, the examination of common life; where she will find
difficulties enough to employ her enquiries, without launching into so
boundless an ocean of doubt, uncertainty, and contradiction! [^1] The
prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be accounted for, from another
cause, viz.

a false sensation of seeming experience which we have, or may have, of
liberty or indifference, in many of our actions. The necessity of any
action, whether of matter or of mind, is not, properly speaking, a
quality in the agent, but in any thinking or intelligent being, who may
con- sider the action; and it consists chiefly in the determination of
his thoughts to infer the existence of that action from some preceding
objects; as liberty, when opposed to necessity, is nothing but the want
of that determination, and a certain looseness or indifference, which we
feel, in passing, or not passing, from the idea of one object to that of
any succeeding one.

Now we may observe, that, though, in reflecting on human actions, we
seldom feel such a looseness, or indifference, but are commonly able to
infer them with considerable certainty from their motives, and from the
dispositions of the agent; yet it frequently happens, that, in
performing the actions themselves, we are sensible of something like it:
And as all resembling objects are readily taken for each other, this has
been employed as a demonstrative and even intuitive proof of human
liberty.

We feel, that our actions are subject to our will, on most occasions;
and imagine we feel, that the will itself is subject to nothing,
because, when by a denial of it we are provoked to try, we feel, that it
moves easily every way, and produces an image of itself (or a Velleity,
as it is called in the schools) even on that side, on which it did not
settle.

This image, or faint motion, we persuade ourselves, could, at that
time, have been compleated into the thing itself; because, should that
be denied, we find, upon a second trial, that, at present, it can.

We consider not, that the fantastical desire of shewing liberty, is
here the motive of our actions.

And it seems certain, that, however we may imagine we feel a liberty
within ourselves, a spec- tator can commonly infer our actions from our
motives and character; and even where he cannot, he concludes in
general, that he might, were he perfectly acquainted with every
circumstance of our situation and temper, and the most secret springs of
our complexion and disposition. Now this is the very essence of
necessity, according to the foregoing doctrine.

[^2] Thus, if a cause be defined, that which produces any thing, it is
easy to observe, that producing is synonymous to causing. In like
manner, if a cause be defined, that by which any thing exists, this is
liable to the same objection.

For what is meant by these words, by which? Had it been said, that a
cause is that after which any thing constantly exists; we should have
understood the terms. For this is, indeed, all we know of the mat-
ter.

And this constantly forms the very essence of necessity, nor have we
any other idea of it.
