Section I : of the Different Species of Philosophy
==================================================

MORAL philosophy, or the science of human nature, may be treated after
two different manners; each of which has its peculiar merit, and may
contribute to the entertainment, instruction, and reformation of man-
kind.

The one considers man chiefly as born for action; and as influenced in
his measures by taste and sentiment; pursuing one object, and avoiding
another, according to the value which these objects seem to possess, and
accord- ing to the light in which they present themselves.

As vir- tue, of all objects, is allowed to be the most valuable, this
species of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colours; borrowing
all helps from poetry and eloquence, and treating their subject in an
easy and obvious manner, and such as is best fitted to please the
imagination, and engage the affections.

They select the most striking observations and instances from common
life; place opposite characters in a proper contrast; and alluring us
into the paths of virtue by the views of glory and happiness, direct our
steps in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious
examples. They make us feel the difference between vice and virtue; they
excite and regulate our sentiments; and so they can but bend our hearts
to the love of probity and true honour, they think, that they have fully
attained the end of all their labours.

The other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a
reasonable rather than an active being, and endeavour to form his
understanding more than cultivate his manners.

They regard human nature as a subject of speculation; and with a narrow
scrutiny examine it, in order to find those principles, which regulate
our under- standing, excite our sentiments, and make us approve or blame
any particular object, action, or behaviour.

They think it a reproach to all literature, that philosophy should not
yet have fixed, beyond controversy, the foundation of morals, reasoning,
and criticism; and should for ever talk of truth and falsehood, vice and
virtue, beauty and de- formity, without being able to determine the
source of these distinctions.

While they attempt this arduous task, they are deterred by no
difficulties; but proceeding from particular instances to general
principles, they still push on their enquiries to principles more
general, and rest not satisfied till they arrive at those original
principles, by which, in every science, all human curiosity must be
bounded.

Though their speculations seem abstract, and even unintelligible to
common readers, they aim at the approbation of the learned and the wise;
and think them- selves sufficiently compensated for the labour of their
whole lives, if they can discover some hidden truths, which may
contribute to the instruction of posterity.

It is certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always, with
the generality of mankind, have the preference above the accurate and
abstruse; and by many will be recommended, not only as more agreeable,
but more useful than the other.

It enters more into common life; moulds the heart and affections; and,
by touching those principles which actuate men, reforms their conduct,
and brings them nearer to that model of perfection which it describes.

On the contrary, the abstruse philosophy, being founded on a turn of
mind, which cannot enter into business and action, vanishes when the
philosopher leaves the shade, and comes into open day; nor can its
principles easily retain any in- fluence over our conduct and behaviour.
The feelings of our heart, the agitation of our passions, the vehemence
of our affections, dissipate all its conclusions, and reduce the
profound philosopher to a mere plebeian.

This also must be confessed, that the most durable, as well as justest
fame, has been acquired by the easy philosophy, and that abstract
reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation,
from the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have not been able
to support their renown with more equitable posterity.

It is easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his
subtile reasonings; and one mistake is the necessary parent of another,
while he pushes on his consequences, and is not deterred from embracing
any conclusion, by its unusual appearance, or its contradiction to
popular opinion. But a philosopher, who purposes only to represent the
common sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engaging colours, if
by accident he falls into error, goes no farther; but renewing his
appeal to common sense, and the natural sentiments of the mind, returns
into the right path, and secures himself from any dangerous illusions.

The fame of Cicero flourishes at present; but that of Aristotle is
utterly decayed.

La Bruyere passes the seas, and still maintains his reputation: but the
glory of Malebranche is confined to his own nation, and to his own age.
And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure, when Locke shall be
entirely forgotten.

The mere philosopher is a character, which is commonly but little
acceptable in the world, as being supposed to contribute nothing either
to the advantage or pleasure of society; while he lives remote from
communication with mankind, and is wrapped up in principles and notions
equally remote from their comprehension.

On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is any
thing deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation
where the sciences flourish, than to be entirely destitute of all relish
for those noble entertainments.

The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes;
retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business;
preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise
from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which
are the natural result of a just philosophy.

In order to diffuse and cultivate so accomplished a character, nothing
can be more useful than compositions of the easy style and manner, which
draw not too much from life, require no deep appli- cation or retreat to
be comprehended, and send back the student among mankind full of noble
sentiments and wise precepts, applicable to every exigence of human
life.

By means of such compositions, virtue becomes amiable, science
agreeable, company instructive, and retirement en- tertaining. Man is a
reasonable being; and as such, receives from science his proper food and
nourishment: But so narrow are the bounds of human understanding, that
little satisfac- tion can be hoped for in this particular, either from
the extent of security or his acquisitions.

Man is a sociable, no less than a reasonable being: but neither can he
always enjoy company agreeable and amusing, or preserve the proper
relish for them.

Man is also an active being; and from that disposition, as well as from
the various necessities of human life, must submit to business and
occupation: but the mind requires some relaxation, and cannot always
support its bent to care and industry.

It seems, then, that nature has pointed out a mixed kind of life as
most suitable to the human race, and secretly admonished them to allow
none of these biases to draw too much, so as to incapacitate them for
other occupations and entertainments.

Indulge your passion for science, says she, but let your science be
human, and such as may have a direct reference to action and society.
Abstruse thought and profound researches I prohibit, and will severely
punish, by the pensive melancholy which they introduce, by the endless
uncertainty in which they involve you, and by the cold reception which
your pretended discoveries shall meet with, when communicated.

Be a philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man. Were
the generality of mankind contented to prefer the easy philosophy to the
abstract and profound, without throwing any blame or contempt on the
latter, it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply with this general
opinion, and allow every man to enjoy, without opposition, his own taste
and sentiment.

But as the matter is often carried farther, even to the absolute
rejecting of all pro- found reasonings, or what is commonly called
metaphysics, we shall now proceed to consider what can reasonably be
pleaded in their behalf.

We may begin with observing, that one considerable advantage, which
results from the accurate and abstract philosophy, is, its subserviency
to the easy and humane; which, without the former, can never attain a
sufficient degree of exactness in its sentiments, precepts, or
reasonings.

All polite letters are nothing but pictures of human life in various
attitudes and situations; and inspire us with different sentiments, of
praise or blame, admiration or ridi- cule, according to the qualities of
the object, which they set before us.

An artist must be better qualified to succeed in this undertaking, who,
besides a delicate taste and a quick apprehension, possesses an accurate
knowledge of the in- ternal fabric, the operations of the understanding,
the workings of the passions, and the various species of senti- ment
which discriminate vice and virtue.

How painful soever this inward search or enquiry may appear, it
becomes, in some measure, requisite to those, who would describe with
success the obvious and outward appearances of life and manners.

The anatomist presents to the eye the most hideous and disagreeable
objects; but his science is useful to the painter in delineating even a
Venus or an Helen.

While the latter employs all the richest colours of his art, and gives
his figures the most graceful and engaging airs; he must still carry his
attention to the inward structure of the human body, the position of the
muscles, the fabric of the bones, and the use and figure of every part
or organ.

Accuracy is, in every case, advantageous to beauty, and just reasoning
to delicate sentiment. In vain would we exalt the one by depreciating
the other.

Besides, we may observe, in every art or profession, even those which
most concern life or action, that a spirit of accuracy, however
acquired, carries all of them nearer their perfection, and renders them
more subservient to the interests of society. And though a philosopher
may live remote from business, the genius of philosophy, if carefully
cultivated by several, must gradually diffuse itself through- out the
whole society, and bestow a similar correctness on every art and
calling.

The politician will acquire greater foresight and subtility, in the
subdividing and balancing of power; the lawyer more method and finer
principles in his reasonings; and the general more regularity in his
discipline, and more caution in his plans and operations.

The stability of modern governments above the ancient, and the accuracy
of modern philosophy, have improved, and probably will still improve, by
similar gradations.

Were there no advantage to be reaped from these studies, beyond the
gratification of an innocent curiosity, yet ought not even this to be
despised; as being one accession to those few safe and harmless
pleasures, which are bestowed on the human race. The sweetest and most
inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues of science and
learning; and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way, or
open up any new prospect, ought so far to be esteemed a benefactor to
mankind.

And though these researches may appear painful and fatiguing, it is
with some minds as with some bodies, which being endowed with vigorous
and florid health, require severe exercise, and reap a pleasure from
what, to the generality of mankind, may seem burden- some and laborious.
Obscurity, indeed, is painful to the mind as well as to the eye; but to
bring light from obscurity, by whatever labour, must needs be delightful
and rejoicing.

But this obscurity in the profound and abstract philos- ophy, is
objected to, not only as painful and fatiguing, but as the inevitable
source of uncertainty and error.

Here in- deed lies the justest and most plausible objection against a
considerable part of metaphysics, that they are not properly a science;
but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human vanity, which would
penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to the understanding, or
from the craft of pop- ular superstitions, which, being unable to defend
themselves on fair ground, raise these intangling brambles to cover and
protect their weakness.

Chased from the open country, these robbers fly into the forest, and
lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the mind, and
overwhelm it with religious fears and prejudices.

The stoutest antagonist, if he remit his watch a moment, is oppressed.
And many, through cowardice and folly, open the gates to the enemies,
and willingly receive them with reverence and submission, as their legal
sovereigns.

But is this a sufficient reason, why philosophers should desist from
such researches, and leave superstition still in possession of her
retreat? Is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion, and perceive
the necessity of carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the
enemy? In vain do we hope, that men, from frequent disappointment, will
at last abandon such airy sciences, and discover the proper province of
human reason.

For, besides, that many persons find too sensible an interest in
perpetually recalling such topics; besides this, I say, the motive of
blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences; since,
how- ever unsuccessful former attempts may have proved, there is still
room to hope, that the industry, good fortune, or improved sagacity of
succeeding generations may reach discoveries unknown to former ages.

Each adventurous genius will still leap at the arduous prize, and find
himself stimulated, rather than discouraged, by the failures of his
predecessors; while he hopes that the glory of achieving so hard an
adventure is reserved for him alone.

The only method of freeing learning, at once, from these abstruse
questions, is to enquire seriously into the nature of human
understanding, and show, from an exact analysis of its powers and
capacity, that it is by no means fitted for such remote and abstruse
subjects. We must submit to this fatigue in order to live at ease ever
after: and must cultivate true metaphysics with some care, in order to
destroy the false and adulterate.

Indolence, which, to some persons, affords a safeguard against this
deceitful philos- ophy, is, with others, overbalanced by curiosity; and
de- spair, which, at some moments, prevails, may give place after- wards
to sanguine hopes and expectations.

Accurate and just reasoning is the only catholic remedy, fitted for all
persons and all dispositions; and is alone able to subvert that abstruse
philosophy and metaphysical jargon, which being mixed up with popular
superstition, renders it in a manner impenetrable to careless reasoners,
and gives it the air of science and wisdom.

Besides this advantage of rejecting, after deliberate en- quiry, the
most uncertain and disagreeable part of learning, there are many
positive advantages, which result from an accurate scrutiny into the
powers and faculties of human nature.

It is remarkable concerning the operations of the mind, that, though
most intimately present to us, yet, whenever they become the object of
reflexion, they seem involved in obscurity; nor can the eye readily find
those lines and boundaries, which discriminate and distinguish them. The
objects are too fine to remain long in the same aspect or situation; and
must be apprehended in an in- stant, by a superior penetration, derived
from nature, and improved by habit and reflexion.

It becomes, therefore, no inconsiderable part of science barely to know
the different operations of the mind, to separate them from each other,
to class them under their proper heads, and to correct all that seeming
disorder, in which they lie involved, when made the object of reflexion
and enquiry.

This talk of ordering and distinguishing, which has no merit, when
performed with regard to external bodies, the objects of our senses,
rises in its value, when directed towards the operations of the mind, in
proportion to the difficulty and labour, which we meet with in
performing it.

And if we can go no farther than this mental geography, or delineation
of the distinct parts and powers of the mind, it is at least a satis-
faction to go so far; and the more obvious this science may appear (and
it is by no means obvious) the more con- temptible still must the
ignorance of it be esteemed, in all pretenders to learning and
philosophy.

Nor can there remain any suspicion, that this science is uncertain and
chimerical; unless we should entertain such a scepticism as is entirely
subversive of all speculation, and even action.

It cannot be doubted, that the mind is endowed with several powers and
faculties, that these powers are distinct from each other, that what is
really distinct to the immediate perception may be distinguished by
reflexion; and consequently, that there is a truth and falsehood in all
propositions on this subject, and a truth and falsehood, which lie not
beyond the compass of human understanding.

There are many obvious distinctions of this kind, such as those between
the will and understanding, the imagination and passions, which fall
within the com- prehension of every human creature; and the finer and
more philosophical distinctions are no less real and certain, though
more difficult to be comprehended.

Some instances, especially late ones, of success in these enquiries,
may give us a juster notion of the certainty and solidity of this branch
of learning.

And shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philosopher to give us a
true system of the planets, and adjust the position and order of those
remote bodies; while we affect to overlook those, who, with so much
success, delineate the parts of the mind, in which we are so intimately
concerned? But may we not hope, that philosophy, cultivated with care,
and encouraged by the attention of the public, may carry its researches
still farther, and discover, at least in some degree, the secret springs
and principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its operations?
Astronomers had long contented themselves with proving, from the
phaenomena, the true motions, order, and magnitude of the heavenly
bodies: till a philosopher, at last, arose, who seems, from the happiest
reasoning, to have also deter- mined the laws and forces, by which the
revolutions of the planets are governed and directed.

The like has been performed with regard to other parts of nature.

And there is no reason to despair of equal success in our enquiries
concerning the mental powers and economy, if prosecuted with equal
capacity and caution.

It is probable, that one operation and principle of the mind depends on
another; which, again, may be resolved into one more general and
universal: and how far these researches may possibly be carried, it will
be difficult for us, before, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to
determine. This is certain, that attempts of this kind are every day
made even by those who philosophize the most negligently: and nothing
can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough
care and attention; that, if it lie within the compass of human
understanding, it may at last be happily achieved; if not, it may,
however, be rejected with some confidence and security.

This last conclusion, surely, is not desirable; nor ought it to be
embraced too rashly.

For how much must we diminish from the beauty and value of this species
of philosophy, upon such a supposition? Moralists have hitherto been
accustomed, when they considered the vast multitude and diversity of
those actions that excite our approbation or dislike, to search for some
common principle, on which this variety of sentiments might depend.

And though they have sometimes carried the matter too far, by their
passion for some one general principle; it must, however, be confessed,
that they are excusable in expecting to find some general principles,
into which all the vices and virtues were justly to be resolved.

The like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians, and even
politicians: nor have their attempts been wholly unsuccessful; though
perhaps longer time, greater accuracy, and more ardent application may
bring these sciences still nearer their per- fection.

To throw up at once all pretensions of this kind may justly be deemed
more rash, precipitate, and dogmatical, than even the boldest and most
affirmative philosophy, that has ever attempted to impose its crude
dictates and prin- ciples on mankind.

What though these reasonings concerning human nature seem abstract, and
of difficult comprehension? This affords no presumption of their
falsehood. On the contrary, it seems impossible, that what has hitherto
escaped so many wise and profound philosophers can be very obvious and
easy. And whatever pains these researches may cost us, we may think
ourselves sufficiently rewarded, not only in point of profit but of
pleasure, if, by that means, we can make any addition to our stock of
knowledge, in subjects of such unspeakable importance.

But as, after all, the abstractedness of these speculations is no
recommendation, but rather a disadvantage to them, and as this
difficulty may perhaps be surmounted by care and art, and the avoiding
of all unnecessary detail, we have, in the following enquiry, attempted
to throw some light upon subjects, from which uncertainty has hitherto
deterred the wise, and obscurity the ignorant.

Happy, if we can unite the boundaries of the different species of
philosophy, by reconciling profound enquiry with clearness, and truth
with novelty! And still more happy, if, reasoning in this easy manner,
we can undermine the foundations of an abstruse philosophy, which seems
to have hitherto served only as a shelter to superstition, and a cover
to absurdity and error!
