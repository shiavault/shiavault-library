Section Ii : of the Origin of Ideas
===================================

EVERY one will readily allow, that there is a consider- able difference
between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of
excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he
afterwards re- calls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by
his imagination. These faculties may mimic or copy the percep- tions of
the senses; but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of
the original sentiment.

The utmost we say of them, even when they operate with greatest vigour,
is, that they represent their object in so lively a manner, that we
could almost say we feel or see it: But, except the mind be disordered
by disease or madness, they never can arrive at such a pitch of
vivacity, as to render these perceptions altogether undistinguishable.

All the colours of poetry, however splendid, can never paint natural
objects in such a manner as to make the description be taken for a real
landskip.

The most lively thought is still inferior to the dullest sensation. We
may observe a like distinction to run through all the other perceptions
of the mind.


A man in a fit of anger, is actuated in a very different manner from
one who only thinks of that emotion.

If you tell me, that any person is in love, I easily understand your
meaning, and from a just conception of his situation; but never can
mistake that conception for the real disorders and agitations of the
passion.

When we reflect on our past sentiments and affections, our thought is a
faithful mirror, and copies its objects truly; but the colours which it
employs are faint and dull, in comparison of those in which our original
per- ceptions were clothed. It requires no nice discernment or
metaphysical head to mark the distinction between them.

Here therefore we may divide all the perceptions of the mind into two
classes or species, which are distinguished by their different degrees
of force and vivacity.

The less forcible and lively are commonly denominated Thoughts or
Ideas. The other species want a name in our language, and in most
others; I suppose, because it was not requisite for any, but
philosophical purposes, to rank them under a general term or
appellation.

Let us, therefore, use a little freedom, and call them Impressions;
employing that word in a sense somewhat different from the usual. By the
term impression, then, I mean all our more lively perceptions, when we
hear, or see, or feel, or love, or hate, or desire, or will. And
impressions are distinguished from ideas, which are the less lively
perceptions, of which we are conscious, when we reflect on any of those
sensations or movements above mentioned.

Nothing, at first view, may seem more unbounded than the thought of
man, which not only escapes all human power and authority, but is not
even restrained within the limits of nature and reality.

To form monsters, and join incongruous shapes and appearances, costs
the imagination no more trouble than to conceive the most natural and
familiar objects.

And while the body is confined to one planet, along which it creeps
with pain and difficulty; the thought can in an instant transport us
into the most dis- tant regions of the universe; or even beyond the
universe, into the unbounded chaos, where nature is supposed to lie in
total confusion. What never was seen, or heard of, may yet be conceived;
nor is any thing beyond the power of thought, except what implies an
absolute contradiction. But though our thought seems to possess this
unbounded liberty, we shall find, upon a nearer examination, that it is
really confined within very narrow limits, and that all this creative
power of the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding,
transposing, augmenting, or diminishing the materials afforded us by the
senses and experience.

When we think of a golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas,
gold, and mountain, with which we were formerly acquainted.

A virtuous horse we can conceive; because, from our own feeling, we can
conceive virtue; and this we may unite to the figure and shape of a
horse, which is an animal familiar to us.

In short, all the materials of thinking are derived either from our
outward or inward sentiment: the mixture and com- position of these
belongs alone to the mind and will.

Or, to express myself in philosophical language, all our ideas or more
feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones. To
prove this, the two following arguments will, I hope, be sufficient.

First, when we analyze our thoughts or ideas, however compounded or
sublime, we always find that they resolve themselves into such simple
ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling or sentiment.

Even those ideas, which, at first view, seem the most wide of this
origin, are found, upon a nearer scrutiny, to be derived from it. The
idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being,
arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and
augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom.

We may prosecute this enquiry to what length we please; where we shall
always find, that every idea which we examine is copied from a similar
impression.

Those who would assert that this position is not universally true nor
without exception, have only one, and that an easy method of refuting
it; by producing that idea, which, in their opinion, is not derived from
this source. It will then be incumbent on us, if we would maintain our
doctrine, to produce the impression, or lively perception, which
corresponds to it. Secondly.

If it happen, from a defect of the organ, that a man is not susceptible
of any species of sensation, we always find that he is as little
susceptible of the cor- respondent ideas. A blind man can form no notion
of colours; a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that sense in
which he is deficient; by opening this new inlet for his sensations, you
also open an inlet for the ideas; and he finds no difficulty in
conceiving these objects.

The case is the same, if the object, proper for exciting any sensation,
has never been applied to the organ. A Lap- lander or Negro has no
notion of the relish of wine. And though there are few or no instances
of a like deficiency in the mind, where a person has never felt or is
wholly incapable of a sentiment or passion that belongs to his species;
yet we find the same observation to take place in a less degree.

A man of mild manners can form no idea of inveterate revenge or
cruelty; nor can a selfish heart easily conceive the heights of
friendship and gener- osity. It is readily allowed, that other beings
may possess many senses of which we can have no conception; because the
ideas of them have never been introduced to us in the only manner by
which an idea can have access to the mind, to wit, by the actual feeling
and sensation. There is, however, one contradictory phenomenon, which
may prove that it is not absolutely impossible for ideas to arise,
independent of their correspondent impressions.

I believe it will readily be allowed, that the several distinct ideas
of colour, which enter by the eye, or those of sound, which are conveyed
by the ear, are really different from each other; though, at the same
time, resembling. Now if this be true of different colours, it must be
no less so of the different shades of the same colour; and each shade
produces a distinct idea, independent of the rest.

For if this should be denied, it is possible, by the continual grada-
tion of shades, to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote from
it; and if you will not allow any of the means to be different, you
cannot, without absurdity, deny the extremes to be the same. Suppose,
therefore, a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to
have become perfectly acquainted with colours of all kinds except one
particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his
fortune to meet with.

Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one, be
placed before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the
lightest; it is plain that he will perceive a blank, where that shade is
wanting, and will be sensible that there is a greater distance in that
place between the contiguous colour than in any other.

Now I ask, whether it be possible for him, from his own imagination, to
supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea of that
particular shade, though it had never been conveyed to him by his
senses? I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can: and
this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas are not always, in every
instance, derived from the correspondent impressions; though this
instance is so singular, that it is scarcely worth our observing, and
does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim.

Here, therefore, is a proposition, which not only seems, in itself,
simple and intelligible; but, if a proper use were made of it, might
render every dispute equally intelligible, and banish all that jargon,
which has so long taken possession of metaphysical reasonings, and drawn
disgrace upon them.

All ideas, especially abstract ones, are naturally faint and obscure:
the mind has but a slender hold of them: they are apt to be confounded
with other resembling ideas; and when we have often employed any term,
though with- out a distinct meaning, we are apt to imagine it has a
deter- minate idea annexed to it.

On the contrary, all impressions, that is, all sensations, either
outward or inward, are strong and vivid: the limits between them are
more exactly deter- mined: nor is it easy to fall into any error or
mistake with regard to them.

When we entertain, therefore, any suspicion that a philosophical term
is employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent), we
need but enquire, from what impression is that supposed idea derived?
And if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our
suspicion. By bringing ideas into so clear a light we may reasonably
hope to remove all dispute, which may arise, concerning their nature and
reality.

[^1] [^1] It is probable that no more was meant by these, who denied
innate ideas, than that all ideas were copies of our impressions; though
it must be confessed, that the terms, which they employed, were not
chosen with such caution, nor so exactly defined, as to prevent all
mistakes about their doctrine.

For what is meant by innate? If innate be equivalent to natural, then
all the perceptions and ideas of the mind must be allowed to be innate
or natural, in whatever sense we take the latter word, whether in
opposi- tion to what is uncommon, artificial, or miraculous. If by
innate be meant, contemporary to our birth, the dispute seems to be
frivolous; nor is it worth while to enquire at what time thinking
begins, whether before, at, or after our birth.

Again, the word idea, seems to be commonly taken in a very loose sense,
by LOCKE and others; as standing for any of our per- ceptions, our
sensations and passions, as well as thoughts.

Now in this sense, I should desire to know, what can be meant by
asserting, that self- love, or resentment of injuries, or the passion
between the sexes is not innate? But admitting these terms, impressions
and ideas, in the sense above explained, and understanding by innate,
what is original or copied from no precedent perception, then may we
assert that all our impressions are innate, and our ideas not innate.

To be ingenuous, I must own it to be my opinion, that LOCKE was
betrayed into this question by the schoolmen, who, making use of unde-
fined terms, draw out their disputes to a tedious length, without ever
touch- ing the point in question.

A like ambiguity and circumlocution seem to run through that
philosopher's reasonings on this as well as most other subjects.
